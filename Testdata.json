non-invasive therapeutic methods which alter the activity of neurons. Currently, several different techniques have been developed - or are currently being investigated - to treat a wide variety of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Recently, in vivo and in vitro studies have revealed that neuromodulation can also induce myelination, meaning that it could hold potential as a therapy for various demyelinating diseases including multiple sclerosis and progressive multifocal leukencepalopathy. These findings come on the heels of a paradigm shift in the view of myelin's role within the nervous system from a static structure to an active co-regulator of central nervous system plasticity and participant in neuron-mediated modulation. In the present review, we highlight several of the recent findings regarding the role of neural activity in altering myelination including several soluble and contact-dependent factors that seem to mediate neural activity-dependent myelination. We also highlight several considerations for neuromodulatory techniques, including the need for further research into spatiotemporal precision, dosage, and the safety and efficacy of transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation, an emerging neuromodulation technology. As the field of neuromodulation continues to evolve, it could potentially bring forth methods for the treatment of demyelinating diseases, and as such, further investigation into the mechanisms of neuron-dependent myelination as well as neuro-imaging modalities that can monitor myelination activity is warranted.", "1": "Astaxanthin (AST) is a carotenoid with anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties. It has also been reported that AST exerts protective effects against neurodegenerative diseases and reduces oxidative stress-induced the central nervous system (CNS) injury. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the protective potential of AST in inhibiting demyelination and oligodendrocyte death in a rat model of multiple sclerosis (MS).", "2": "The brain is one of the organs that are preferentially targeted by adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, a posttranscriptional modification. This chemical modification affects neuronal development and functions at multiple levels, leading to normal brain homeostasis by increasing the complexity of the transcriptome. This includes modulation of the properties of ion channel and neurotransmitter receptors by recoding, redirection of miRNA targets by changing sequence complementarity, and suppression of immune response by altering RNA structure. Therefore, from another perspective, it appears that the brain is highly vulnerable to dysregulation of A-to-I RNA editing. Here, we focus on how aberrant A-to-I RNA editing is involved in neurological and neurodegenerative diseases of humans including epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, psychiatric disorders, developmental disorders, brain tumors, and encephalopathy caused by autoimmunity. In addition, we provide information regarding animal models to better understand the mechanisms behind disease phenotype.", "3": "Cognitive impairment is a common clinical manifestation of multiple sclerosis, but its pathophysiology is not completely understood. White and grey matter injury together with synaptic dysfunction do play a role. The measurement of biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid and the study of their association with cognitive impairment may provide interesting in vivo evidence of the biological mechanisms underlying multiple sclerosis-related cognitive impairment. So far, only a few studies on this topic have been published, giving interesting results that deserve further investigation. Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of different pathophysiological mechanisms seem to reflect different neuropsychological patterns of cognitive deficits in multiple sclerosis. The aim of this review is to discuss the studies that have correlated cerebrospinal fluid markers of immune, glial and neuronal pathology with cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis. Although preliminary, these findings suggest that cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers show some correlation with cognitive performance in multiple sclerosis, thus providing interesting insights into the mechanisms underlying the involvement of specific cognitive domains.", "4": "The COVID-19 epidemic has brought a number of changes to health systems, including the provision of health services to patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Work in the Clinic for Neurology of the Clinical Center of Montenegro (CN-CCM) with MS patients continued as much as possible during the epidemic. The administration of the already started disease-modifying therapy (DMT) continued, and the introduction of the new one was postponed until the moment when the epidemic started to slow down. During the epidemic period, plasmapheresis treatment was performed in CN-CCM without any complications. New ways of communications (special e-mail address and phone line) with MS patients during epidemic were realized. During epidemic, smaller number of relapses were reported compared to same period in 2019. There were not MS patients in Montenegro suffering from SARS-Cov2 virus infection.", "5": "Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-<i>\u043a</i>B) inhibition represents a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases. In this study, a series of 3,4-dihydronaphthalen-1(<i>2H</i>)-one (DHN; <b>6a-n, 7a-c</b>) derivatives were synthesised and characterised by NMR and HRMS. We assessed the toxicity and anti-neuroinflammatory properties of these compounds and found that <b>6m</b> showed the greatest anti-neuroinflammatory properties, with relatively low toxicity. Specifically, <b>6m</b> significantly reduced reactive oxygen species production, down-regulated the expression of NOD-like receptor pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), and caspase-1 and prevented lipopolysaccharide-stimulated BV2 microglia cells polarisation towards an M1 phenotype. Furthermore, <b>6m</b> significantly decreased I<i>\u03ba</i>B<i>\u03b1</i> and NF-<i>\u043a</i>B p65 phosphorylation, thus inhibiting the NF-<i>\u043a</i>B signalling pathway. This suggests that <b>6m</b> may be explored as a functional anti-neuroinflammatory agent for the treatment of inflammatory diseases in the central nervous system, such as multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, stroke and spinal cord injury.", "6": "The dopaminergic system controls several vital central nervous system functions, including the control of movement, reward behaviors and cognition. Alterations of dopaminergic signaling are involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, in particular Parkinson's disease, which are associated with a subtle and chronic inflammatory response. A substantial body of evidence has demonstrated the non-neuronal expression of dopamine, its receptors and of the machinery that governs synthesis, secretion and storage of dopamine across several immune cell types. This review aims to summarize current knowledge on the role and expression of dopamine in immune cells. One of the goals is to decipher the complex mechanisms through which these cell types respond to dopamine, in order to address the impact this has on neurodegenerative and psychiatric pathologies such as Parkinson's disease. A further aim is to illustrate the gaps in our understanding of the physiological roles of dopamine to encourage more targeted research focused on understanding the consequences of aberrant dopamine production on immune regulation. These highlights may prompt scientists in the field to consider alternative functions of this important neurotransmitter when targeting neuroinflammatory/neurodegenerative pathologies.", "7": "A growing number of studies support that the bidirectional interactions between the gut microbiota, the immune system and the CNS are relevant for the pathophysiology of MS. Several studies have reported alterations in the gut microbiome of MS patients. In addition, a variety of studies in animal models of MS have suggested that specific members of the gut commensal microbiota can exacerbate or ameliorate neuroinflammation. Probiotics represent oral nontoxic immunomodulatory agents that would exert benefits when using in combination with current MS therapy. Here we investigate the effect of Vivomixx on the gut microbiome and central and peripheral immune responses in a murine model of primary progressive MS. Vivomixx administration was associated with increased abundance of many taxa such as <i>Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Tenericutes</i> and <i>TM7</i>. This was accompanied by a clear improvement of the motor disability of Theiler's virus infected mice; in the CNS Vivomixx reduced microgliosis, astrogliosis and leukocyte infiltration. Notably, the presence of Breg cells (CD19<sup>+</sup>CD5<sup>+</sup>CD1d<sup>high</sup>) in the CNS was enhanced by Vivomixx, and while spinal cord gene expression of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 was diminished, the probiotic promoted IL-10 gene expression. One of the most significant findings was the increased plasma levels of butyrate and acetate levels in TMEV-mice that received Vivomixx. Peripheral immunological changes were subtle but interestingly, the probiotic restricted IL-17 production by Th17-polarized CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells purified from the mesenteric lymph nodes of Theiler's virus infected mice. Our data reinforce the beneficial effects of oral probiotics that would be coadjuvant treatments to current MS therapies.", "8": "To compile and synthesize the available literature describing medical cannabis use across various disease states.", "9": "The choroid plexus (CP) is located in the ventricular system of the brain (one in each ventricle), and the CP epithelial cells form an important barrier between the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Their main function comprises CSF secretion, maintenance of brain homeostasis, signalling, and forming a neuroprotective barrier against harmful external and internal compounds. The CPs mature early and demonstrate expressional changes of barrier-specific genes and proteins related to location and developmental stage of the CP. Important proteins for the barrier function include tight junction proteins, numerous transporters and enzymes. Natural senescence leads to structural changes in the CP cells and reduced or loss of function, while further loss of CP function and changes in immune status may be relevant in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Multiple Sclerosis. Neuroprotective genes expressed at CPs may be unexplored targets for new therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.", "10": "The dysregulation of the concentration of individual circulating microRNAs or small sets of them has been recognized as a marker of disease. For example, an increase of the concentration of circulating miR-17 has been linked to lung cancer and metastatic breast cancer, while its decrease has been found in multiple sclerosis and gastric cancer. Consequently, techniques for the fast, specific and simple quantitation of microRNAs are becoming crucial enablers of early diagnosis and therapeutic follow-up. DNA based biosensors can serve this purpose, overcoming some of the drawbacks of conventional lab-based techniques. Herein, we report a cost-effective, simple and robust biosensor based on localized surface plasmon resonance and hybridization chain reaction. Immobilized gold nanoparticles are used for the detection of miR-17. Specificity of the detection was achieved by the use of hairpin surface-tethered probes and the hybridization chain reaction was used to amplify the detection signal and thus extend the dynamic range of the quantitation. Less than 1\u00a0h is needed for the entire procedure that achieved a limit of detection of about 1 pM or 50\u00a0amol/measurement, well within the reported useful range for diagnostic applications. We suggest that this technology could be a promising substitute of traditional lab-based techniques for the detection and quantification of miRNAs after these are extracted from diagnostic specimens and their analysis is thus made possible.", "11": "The present study examines functional contributions of microglia in host defense, demyelination, and remyelination following infection of susceptible mice with a neurotropic coronavirus. Treatment with PLX5622, an inhibitor of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) that efficiently depletes microglia, prior to infection of the central nervous system (CNS) with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) resulted in increased mortality compared with control mice that correlated with impaired control of viral replication. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNASeq) of CD45+ cells isolated from the CNS revealed that PLX5622 treatment resulted in muted CD4+ T cell activation profile that was associated with decreased expression of transcripts encoding MHC class II and CD86 in macrophages but not dendritic cells. Evaluation of spinal cord demyelination revealed a marked increase in white matter damage in PLX5622-treated mice that corresponded with elevated expression of transcripts encoding disease-associated proteins Osteopontin (Spp1), Apolipoprotein E (Apoe), and Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2) that were enriched within macrophages. In addition, PLX5622 treatment dampened expression of Cystatin F (Cst7), Insulin growth factor 1 (Igf1), and lipoprotein lipase (Lpl) within macrophage populations which have been implicated in promoting repair of damaged nerve tissue and this was associated with impaired remyelination. Collectively, these findings argue that microglia tailor the CNS microenvironment to enhance control of coronavirus replication as well as dampen the severity of demyelination and influence repair.", "12": "To review current literature regarding sacral neuromodulation (SNM) for neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) focused on indications, barriers and latest technological developments.", "13": "Emotional distress (defined as any negative mood state, including anxiety, depression, trauma symptoms and global distress) is common in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS).

Bradycardia was induced by atrioventricular node ablation in isoflurane-anesthetized New Zealand White rabbits (n\u00a0=\u00a05), and the ventricle was electrically driven at 60 beats/min throughout the experiment, except when extrasystoles appeared. Intravenous administration of clinically relevant dose of 0.03\u00a0mg/kg of clemastine and 10-times higher dose of 0.3\u00a0mg/kg hardly affected the QT interval or duration of the monophasic action potential (MAP) of the ventricle. Additional administration of clemastine at 3\u00a0mg/kg significantly increased the QT interval, MAP duration and the short-term variability of repolarization. Meanwhile, the premature ventricular contractions with R on T phenomenon were observed in 3 out of 5 animals, and torsades de pointes arrhythmias were detected in 1 out of 5 animals. These results suggest that the torsadogenic potential of clemastine is obviously observed in the acute atrioventricular block rabbit, which will not appear within the prescribed dose for multiple sclerosis.", "15": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, characterized by apoptotic death of mature oligodendrocytes, neuroinflammation, and motor dysfunction. A pentacyclic triterpenoid compound, ursolic acid (UA), has various pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-apoptotic effects. In the present study, we investigated the effects of UA on cuprizone-induced demyelination, which is a model of MS. Oral administration of UA effectively suppressed cuprizone-induced demyelination and motor dysfunction via the enhancement of IGF-1 levels in the demyelinating lesions. Our results suggest that UA might be therapeutically useful for demyelination in MS.", "16": "4-Aminopyridine (4-AP), an FDA-approved drug for the symptomatic treatment of multiple sclerosis, is used to improve neuromuscular function in patients with diverse demyelinating disorders. We recently demonstrated that local, transdermal or injectable forms of 4-AP improve myelination, nerve conduction velocity, muscle atrophy, and motor function after traumatic peripheral nerve injury in mice. While oral 4-AP is most commonly used in the clinic, it is unknown whether human equivalent oral doses of 4-AP have effects on traumatic peripheral nerve injury differentiation, myelination, muscle atrophy, functional recovery, and post-injury inflammatory processes in animals. Mice with sciatic nerve crush or denervation injury received oral or intraperitoneal 4-AP (10 \u03bcg) or vehicle alone and were examined for pharmacokinetics, motor function, muscle mass, intrinsic muscle force, nerve morphological and gene expression profiles. 4-AP showed linear pharmacokinetics and the maximum plasma 4-AP concentrations were proportional to 4-AP dose. Acute single dose of oral 4-AP administration induced a rapid transient improvement in motor function that was different in traumatic peripheral nerve injury with or without nerve continuity, chronic daily oral 4-AP treatment significantly enhanced post crush injury motor function recovery and this effect was associated with improved myelination, muscle mass, and ex vivo muscle force. Polymerase chain reaction array analysis with crushed nerve revealed significant alterations in gene involved in axonal inflammation and regeneration. These findings provide convincing evidence that regardless of the route of administration, 4-AP can acutely differentiate traumatic peripheral nerve injury with or without nerve continuity and can enhance in vivo functional recovery with better preservation of myelin sheaths, muscle mass, and muscle force. The animal experiments were approved by the University Committee on Animal Research (UCAR) at the University of Rochester (UCAR-2009-019) on March 31, 2017.", "17": "Mast cells are immune cells of the myeloid lineage that are found throughout the body, including the central nervous system. They perform many functions associated with innate and specific immunity, angiogenesis, and vascular homeostasis. Moreover, they have been implicated in a series of pathologies (e.g., hypersensitivity reactions, tumors, and inflammatory disorders). In this review, we propose that this cell could be a relevant therapeutic target in multiple sclerosis, which is a central nervous system degenerative disease. To support this proposition, we describe the general biological properties of mast cells, their contribution to innate and specific immunity, and the participation of mast cells in the various stages of multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis development. The final part of this review is dedicated to an overview of the available mast cells immunomodulatory drugs and their activity on multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, including our own experience related to the effect of ketotifen fumarate on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis evolution.", "18": "Fast and efficient transmission of electrical signals in the nervous system is mediated through myelinated nerve fibers. In neuronal diseases such as multiple sclerosis, the conduction properties of axons are disturbed by the removal of the myelin sheath, leaving nerve cells at a higher risk of degenerating. In some cases, the protective myelin sheath of axons can be rebuilt by remyelination through oligodendroglial cells. In any case, however, changes in the ion channel organization occur and may help to restore impulse conduction after demyelination. On the other hand, changes in ion channel distribution may increase the energy demand of axons, thereby increasing the probability of axonal degeneration. Many attempts have been made or discussed in recent years to increase remyelination of affected axons in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. These approaches range from pharmacological treatments that reduce inflammatory processes or block ion channels to the modulation of neuronal activity through electrical cortical stimulation. However, these treatments either affect the entire organism (pharmacological) or exert a very local effect (electrodes). Current results show that neuronal activity is a strong regulator of oligodendroglial development. To bridge the gap between global and very local treatments, non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation could be considered. Transcranial magnetic stimulation is externally applied to brain areas and experiments with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation show that the neuronal activity can be modulated depending on the stimulation parameters in both humans and animals. In this review, we discuss the possibilities of influencing ion channel distribution and increasing neuronal activity by transcranial magnetic stimulation as well as the effect of this modulation on oligodendroglial cells and their capacity to remyelinate previously demyelinated axons. Although the physiological mechanisms underlying the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation clearly need further investigations, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation may be a promising approach for non-invasive neuronal modulation aiming at enhancing remyelination and thus reducing neurodegeneration.", "19": "The immune response is influenced by the administration of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA).

The combination of evening primrose/hemp seed oil (EPO/HSO) has essential fatty acids (EFAs) for human optimal health due to the favorable ratio of omega-6/omega-3 and antioxidantal properties. The study was conducted to evaluate the effects of EPO/HSO on improving the membrane fatty acids composition of spleen and blood cells and immunologic factors in compared to rapamycin (RAPA) in the EAE model.", "20": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system characterized by the autoimmune inflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration. This complex disease develops in genetically predisposed individuals under adverse environmental factors. To date, a large number of MS-associated polymorphic loci of the nuclear genome have been identified; however, their total variability can explain only about 48% of the observed inheritance of MS. Polymorphic variants of the mitochondrial genome and interactions of mitochondrial and nuclear genes (mitonuclear interactions) may be the possible sources of the \"missing heritability\". We analyzed the association with MS of 10 mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms (m.1719, m.4216, m.4580, m.4917, m.7028, m.9055, m.10398, m.12308, m.13368, m.13708) in DNA of 540 MS patients and 406 healthy individuals. The allele m.9055*G was the only mitochondrial variant associated with MS (P<sub>f</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.027). To evaluate interactions of mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, we searched for biallelic combinations containing one of 10 mitochondrial variants and one of 35 variants of immune-related nuclear genes. Carriership of mitochondrial variants m.4216, m.4580, or m.13708 in biallelic combinations with variants of nuclear genes IL7R, CLEC16A, CD6, CD86 or PVT1 was associated with MS (P<sub>f</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.0036-0.00030). We identified epistatic interaction between components of a combination (m.13708*A\u00a0+\u00a0PVT1 rs4410871*T). The existence of epistatic biallelic combination can reflect the genuine mitonuclear epistasis.", "21": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a clinically heterogeneous multifactorial disorder which is one of the most prevalent neurological disorders of females and young people. Both genetic and environmental factors are playing an important role in the pathophysiology of MS. The main objective of this study is to identify the relationship between numbers of genetic variants within different candidate genes (IL7R, LAG3, and CD40) and the risk of developing MS in the Jordanian Arab population. This case-control study consists of 218 MS patients chosen from neurology clinics at different hospitals in Jordan and ethnically matched 227 healthy controls. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples. Genotyping of the candidate gene polymorphisms was conducted using the Sequenom MassARRAY system. Statistical analysis was performed to identify the genetic association of the studied SNPs with MS. Twenty-one variants were studied, three of them were found to be associated with MS (rs6897932 (P-value\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and rs13188960 (P-value\u00a0=\u00a00.005) within IL7R gene and LAG3 rs2365095, (P-value\u00a0=\u00a00.03) within LAG3 gene). Moreover, no significant association was found between MS and the genetic polymorphisms of the CD40 gene. After correction for multiple comparisons, only rs13188960 SNP remained significantly with MS. This is the first study of the genetic association with MS in the Jordanian Arab population to provided evidence of the genetic association of IL7R (rs6897932, rs13188960) and LAG3 (rs2365095) gene polymorphisms with MS. These findings may contribute to our understanding of MS and optimize the therapy protocol for individuals.", "22": "Numerous studies report that changes in extracellular matrix components and receptors, such as CD44, contribute to immune cell recruitment and thus lesion formation in multiple sclerosis (MS). In the present study, we used the cuprizone model to elucidate the expression pattern of CD44 in a toxin-induced MS model. Therefore, tissues of cuprizone-intoxicated mice were analyzed by real-time qRT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining against CD44. Co-localization analyses of CD44-positive cells with glial cell markers were performed by immunofluorescence labeling and in-situ hybridization. To investigate the functional importance of CD44 expression for myelination and glial cell activation, Cd44-deficient mice were used. In this study we demonstrate that CD44 expression is induced in a time-dependent manner in an autoimmune-independent model of MS. Up-regulation of CD44 expression was primarily associated to the superficial and perivascular glia limitans and demyelinated white matter structures, particularly the corpus callosum. In the demyelinated corpus callosum, CD44 was localized on GFAP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes and IBA1<sup>+</sup> microglial cells. Despite a robust expression induction, Cd44-deficiency did not ameliorate cuprizone-induced pathology. Although further studies will be needed to examine the functional relevance of CD44 in the cuprizone model, the spatial and temporal expression pattern of CD44 will pave the way to evaluate its precise role in different (immune and non-immune) pathological conditions.", "23": "To investigate the relationship between TNFA-308G\u00a0>\u00a0A, IL10-1082A\u00a0>\u00a0G, IL18-607C\u00a0>\u00a0A, and cognitive functioning in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).", "24": "Given its highly variable clinical course, an unmet need for objective prognostic assessment in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) persists. In this work, we suggest that CSF kappa free light chains (KFLC) determination at first relapse may provide insight into future disease activity and disability worsening. We quantified KFLC by nephelometry in paired CSF/serum samples of 28 patients, collected within one month of first-ever MS relapse, and explored correlations with clinical data on disease activity, retrospectively registered across a median follow-up time of 79\u00a0months. We documented KFLC ratio (CSF-FKLC/Serum-KFLC) as an independent predictor of second relapse occurrence and disability worsening at follow-up, in this cohort.", "25": "Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMP) and Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) are cytokines with similar receptors and messengers. They are important for immune cell function, with BMPs exerting mainly proinflammatory but also anti-inflammatory effects, and TGF-\u03b2 suppressing inflammation. Patients with Multiple Sclerosis exhibit BMP overactivity and suppressed TGF-\u03b2 signaling. This dysregulated signaling participates in the crosstalk between infiltrating immune cells and glia, where BMP inhibits remyelination. Reciprocal antagonism between the two pathways takes place via a variety of mechanisms. Although this antagonism has not been studied in the setting of Multiple Sclerosis, it could inform further research and treatment discovery.", "26": "Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is the most prevalent MS subtype. Years after disease onset, most of RRMS patients show transition into secondary progressive form (SPMS). Currently, no biomarkers are available for tracking disease progression. Here, we observed marked elevation of Rho-associated protein kinase 2 (ROCK2) along with significant downregulation of miRNAs 300 and 450b-5p expressions in the serum of 39 RRMS and 35 SPMS Egyptian patients compared to healthy controls. More pronounced alterations were found in SPMS versus RRMS patients. Our findings also suggest relations between elevated ROCK2 and reduced expression of both miRNAs with the degree of disability and disease progression. Notably, these biomarkers effectively discriminated RRMS from SPMS patients with miR-450b-5p showing the highest prognostic power.", "27": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) with various clinical manifestations. The characteristic of MS is that myelin is attacked by the body's immune system and increases the electrical capacity of axons, and is the primary pathophysiological mechanism of the transmission block. Studies have shown that epigenetic factors participate in the development of MS. LncRNAs are highly abundant and heterogeneous linear RNA transcripts with lengths exceeding 200 nucleotides and no protein-coding potential. Currently, pieces of evidence have demonstrated that lncRNAs have fundamental actions in multiple cellular pathways, including immune system regulation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cancer cell growth and metastasis, cellular homeostasis, and embryo development. It has been demonstrated that epigenetic mechanisms have an abundant role in the pathogenesis of MS in which the role of lncRNAs as epigenetic regulatory molecules in molecular processes has been proven. In this paper, we have focused on the correlation between MS and lncRNAs, the role of lncRNA in the pathogenesis of the disease, and the diagnostic and prognostic potential of lncRNA in MS.", "28": "This study aims to compare NK cells obtained from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients receiving interferon-\u03b21 and fingolimod therapies.

Alternatively, comparative transcriptomics and pathway analyses revealed significant distinctions between two therapy modalities. Molecular signature of the CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells from fingolimod-treated MS patients was closely associated to those from healthy subjects. The basic assets of NK cells were modestly influenced by interferon-\u03b21 and fingolimod, however transcriptomics showed profound alterations in NK responses.", "29": "An algorithm Probabilistic Identification of Causal SNPs, identified 434 causal variants for multiple sclerosis (MS) including IL2RA rs2104286, IFI30 rs11554159 and IKZF3 rs12946510. Analysis of individual and combined effects of these variants in the Serbian population identified that Il2RA rs2104286 G allele carriers had a lower risk for developing MS (gender adjusted OR\u202f=\u202f0.63, p\u202f=\u202f.003). With regard to the IFI30 rs11554159 recessive genetic model, among HLA-DRB1*15:01 positive patients, the AA homozygote had a significantly higher MSSS compared to the G allele carriers (p\u202f=\u202f.003). This study confirms role of IL2RA rs2104286 in MS and suggest the role of IFI30 rs11554159 in disease severity, which needs validation.", "30": "This study aimed to quantitatively review and summarize the effectiveness and safety of rituximab (RTX) treatment for patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).", "31": "Paroxysmal dysarthria and ataxia (PDA) syndrome constitutes a rare neurological disorder, and is generally reported in cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) involving the midbrain. We present an illustrative case of 32-year-old female who developed clinically isolated syndrome manifested paroxysmal dysarthria, ataxia, ptosis and diplopia, coexisting with anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antibodies. We review the literature and identify 23 other cases with brain MRI examinations to summarize the lesion locations and clinical characteristics of PDA syndrome, and ultimately provide a new framework for understanding this rare condition. The current case expands the spectrum of symptoms in PDA syndrome, which was including but not limited to dysarthria and ataxia. Caudal paramedian midbrain lesions involving decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncles appear to be critical for PDA syndrome.", "32": "Oligoclonal bands and increased IgG antibody levels can be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid in vast majority of patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). However, the antigenic specificity of oligoclonal IgG has yet to be determined. Using laser capture microdissection, we isolated single CD38+ plasma cells from lesion areas in two autopsy MS brains, and generated three recombinant antibodies (rAbs) from clonally expanded plasma cells. Panning phage-displayed random peptide libraries was carried out to determine peptide antigen specificities of these MS brain rAbs. We identified 25 high affinity phage peptides from which 5 peptides are unique. Database searches revealed that they shared sequence homologies with Epstein-Barr nuclear antigens 4 and 6, as well as with other viral proteins. Significantly, these peptides were recognized by intrathecal IgG and oligoclonal IgG bands in other MS patients. Our results demonstrate that functional recombinant antibodies can be generated from clonally expanded plasma cells in MS brain lesions by laser capture microdissection, and that these MS brain rAbs have the potential for determining the targets of intrathecal IgG and oligoclonal bands.", "33": "Prognostication in multiple sclerosis (MS) remains challenging.

We retrospectively reviewed 1425 consecutive patients referred for neuro-ophthalmic assessment who had high quality OCT scans and reliable Humphrey 24-2 SITA-Fast testing. A total of 7 patients, 3 females and 4 males, with a mean age of 39.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.5\u00a0years that had homonymous thinning of the OCT macular-GCIPL without significant visual field defects were included in the study. Four patients had demyelinating disease and 3 patients had traumatic brain injury. Three patients with demyelinating disease had a documented prior homonymous visual field defect that resolved. The differential diagnosis of homonymous hemimacular thinning of the GCIPL without obvious visual field defects includes previous retrochiasmal demyelination and traumatic brain injury. OCT GCIPL provides a permanent objective way of documenting previous retrochiasmal disease including demyelination and may be helpful in establishing dissemination in time and space in patients being evaluated for multiple sclerosis.", "35": "As available disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) increase, evaluating benefit/risk presents greater difficulties, requiring people with MS (PwMS) to play crucial roles in choosing treatment. Although individual attitude toward risk may predict this evaluation, its relation to personality is little studied in MS literature.", "36": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory, demyelinating, and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) triggered by autoimmune mechanisms. Microglia are critical for the clearance of myelin debris in areas of demyelination, a key step to allow remyelination. TREM2 is expressed by microglia and promotes microglial survival, proliferation, and phagocytic activity. Herein we demonstrate that TREM2 was highly expressed on myelin-laden phagocytes in active demyelinating lesions in the CNS of subjects with MS. In gene expression studies, macrophages from subjects with TREM2 genetic deficiency displayed a defect in phagocytic pathways. Treatment with a\u00a0new TREM2 agonistic antibody\u00a0promoted the clearance of myelin debris in the cuprizone model of CNS demyelination. Effects included enhancement of myelin uptake and\u00a0degradation, resulting in\u00a0accelerated myelin debris removal by microglia. Most importantly, antibody-dependent TREM2 activation on microglia increased density of oligodendrocyte precursors in areas of demyelination, as well as the\u00a0formation of mature oligodendrocytes thus enhancing remyelination and axonal integrity. These results are relevant as they propose TREM2 on microglia as a potential new target to promote remyelination.", "37": "Anti-CD20-mediated B-cell depletion effectively reduces acute multiple sclerosis (MS) flares. Recent data shows that antibody-mediated extinction of B cells as a lasting immune suppression, harbors the risk of developing humoral deficiencies over time. Accordingly, more selective, durable and reversible B-cell-directed MS therapies are needed. We here tested inhibition of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), an enzyme centrally involved in B-cell receptor signaling, as the most promising approach in this direction. Using mouse models of MS, we determined that evobrutinib, the first BTK inhibiting molecule being developed, dose-dependently inhibited antigen-triggered activation and maturation of B cells as well as their release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Most importantly, evobrutinib treatment functionally impaired the capacity of B cells to act as antigen-presenting cells for the development of encephalitogenic T cells, resulting in a significantly reduced disease severity in mice. In contrast to anti-CD20, BTK inhibition silenced this key property of B cells in MS without impairing their frequency or functional integrity. In conjunction with a recent phase II trial reporting that evobrutinib is safe and effective in MS, our mechanistic data highlight therapeutic BTK inhibition as a landmark towards selectively interfering with MS-driving B-cell properties.", "38": "The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 (IL-1) is crucially involved in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Herein, we studied the role of IL-1 signaling in blood-brain barrier (BBB) endothelial cells (ECs), astrocytes and microglia for EAE development, using mice with the conditional deletion of its signaling receptor IL-1R1. We found that IL-1 signaling in microglia and astrocytes is redundant for the development of EAE, whereas the IL-1R1 deletion in BBB-ECs markedly ameliorated disease severity. IL-1 signaling in BBB-ECs upregulated the expression of the adhesion molecules Vcam-1, Icam-1 and the chemokine receptor Darc, all of which have been previously shown to promote CNS-specific inflammation. In contrast, IL-1R1 signaling suppressed the expression of the stress-responsive heme catabolizing enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in BBB-ECs, promoting disease progression via a mechanism associated with deregulated expression of the IL-1-responsive genes Vcam1, Icam1 and Ackr1 (Darc). Mechanistically, our data emphasize a functional crosstalk of BBB-EC IL-1 signaling and HO-1, controlling the transcription of downstream proinflammatory genes promoting the pathogenesis of autoimmune neuroinflammation.", "39": "The novel Coronavirus disease of 2019 (nCOV-19) is a viral outbreak noted first in Wuhan, China. This disease is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus (CoV)-2. In the past, other members of the coronavirus family, such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), have made an impact in China and the Arabian peninsula respectively. Both SARS and COVID-19 share similar symptoms such as fever, cough, and difficulty in breathing that can become fatal in later stages. However, SARS and MERS infections were epidemic diseases constrained to limited regions. By March 2020 the SARS-CoV-2 had spread across the globe and on March 11th, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as pandemic disease. In severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, many patients succumbed to pneumonia. Higher rates of deaths were seen in older patients who had co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and dementia. In this review paper, we discuss the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on CNS diseases, such as Alzheimer's-like dementia, and diabetes mellitus. We also focus on the virus genome, pathophysiology, theranostics, and autophagy mechanisms. We will assess the multiorgan failure reported in advanced stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our paper will provide mechanistic clues and therapeutic targets for physicians and investigators to combat COVID-19.", "40": "Speech production relies on motor control and cognitive processing and is linked to cerebellar function. In diseases where the cerebellum is impaired, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), speech abnormalities are common and can be detected by instrumental assessments. However, the potential of speech assessments to be used to monitor cerebellar impairment in MS remains unexplored. The aim of this study is to build an objectively measured speech score that reflects cerebellar function, pathology and quality of life in MS. Eighty-five people with MS and 21 controls participated in the study. Speech was independently assessed through objective acoustic analysis and blind expert listener ratings. Cerebellar function and overall disease disability were measured through validated clinical scores; cerebellar pathology was assessed via magnetic resonance imaging, and validated questionnaires informed quality of life. Selected speech variables were entered in a regression model to predict cerebellar function. The resulting model was condensed into one composite speech score and tested for prediction of abnormal 9-hole peg test (9HPT), and for correlations with the remaining cerebellar scores, imaging measurements and self-assessed quality of life. Slow rate of syllable repetition and increased free speech pause percentage were the strongest predictors of cerebellar impairment, complemented by phonatory instability. Those variables formed the acoustic composite score that accounted for 54% of variation in cerebellar function, correlated with cerebellar white matter volume (r\u2009=\u20090.3, p\u2009=\u00a00.017), quality of life (r\u2009=\u20090.5, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and predicted an abnormal 9HPT with 85% accuracy. An objective multi-feature speech metric was highly representative of motor cerebellar impairment in MS.", "41": "PET targeting the translocator protein (TSPO) expression is an interesting approach to detect neuroinflammation, as TSPO is upregulated in activated macrophages and microglia. Considering the variable pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) variants, we compare TSPO PET using F-GE-180 in 3 different demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system: relapsing-remitting MS, tumefactive MS, and Bal\u00f3's concentric sclerosis.

The same symptoms are seen in the biological process of aging (years of age\u00a0>\u00a060\u00a0years). Nonetheless, no previous studies have examined the combined effects of aging and multiple sclerosis (MS) in regards to lower extremity muscle strength concomitant with physical function (e.g. walking capacity). The aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine potential differences in pwMS vs. healthy controls (HC) across the adult lifespan in these outcomes.", "46": "The role of interferon \u03b2-1b (IFN\u03b2-1b), used for multiple sclerosis (MS) therapy, in cancer occurrence is uncertain. There is evidence supporting the role of human herpesvirus 4 [Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)] in thyroid cancer and MS. Simultaneous occurrence of papillary and medullary carcinomas is rare, and its association with MS in a young woman raises questions. A 46-year-old female patient was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in 2008. In 2018, cervical MRI detected a thyroid nodule with right cervical adenopathy. Her thyroid function was normal, but increased calcitonin levels were found (70.53 pg/ml; normal value: <9.82 pg/ml). EBV serology tested positive. Paraclinical studies ruled out multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome. Whole thyroid resection with whole cervical lymph node dissection was performed. To our knowledge, this is the first case that describes an association between MS and thyroid collision tumors. Histological examination ascertained both papillary and medullary thyroid cancer. After surgery, the calcitonin level normalized, and the patient received a therapeutic dose of iodine-131. IFN\u03b2-1b therapy was discontinued. The coexistence of thyroid cancers in MS patients could be explained by immune-mediated inflammation. Although EBV is not the only agent responsible for the development of MS or thyroid cancers, it could be considered a contributory factor in our case. Further research on EBV involvement in the occurrence of simultaneous immune pathologies in various organs is needed to confirm these data.", "47": "Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition known to affect about 1%-3% of the global population.

FUS mutations are associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS) and frontotemporal lobe degeneration (FTLD) in humans. At the molecular level, the mutated FUS protein is reduced in the nucleus but accumulates in cytoplasmic granules. Oligodendrocytes (OL) carrying clinically relevant FUS mutations contribute to non-cell autonomous motor neuron disease progression, consistent with an extrinsic mechanism of disease mediated by OL. Knocking out FUS globally or in neurons lead to behavioral abnormalities that are similar to those present in FTLD. In this study, we sought to investigate whether an extrinsic mechanism mediated by loss of FUS function in OL contributes to the behavioral phenotype. We have generated a novel conditional knockout (cKO) in which Fus is selectively depleted in OL (Fus<sup>OL</sup> cKO). The Fus<sup>OL</sup> cKO mice show increased novelty-induced motor activity and enhanced exploratory behavior, which are reminiscent of some manifestations of FTLD. The phenotypes are associated with greater myelin thickness, higher number of myelinated small diameter axons without an increase in the number of mature OL. The expression of the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis (HMGCR) is increased in white matter tracts of the Fus<sup>OL</sup> cKO and results in higher cholesterol content. In addition, phosphorylation of Akt, an important regulator of myelination is increased in the Fus<sup>OL</sup> cKO. Collectively, this work has uncovered a novel role of oligodendrocytic Fus in regulating myelin deposition through activation of Akt and cholesterol biosynthesis.", "49": "In the last decade, microRNAs have been increasingly recognized as key modulators of glial development. Recently, we identified miR-125a-3p as a new player in oligodendrocyte physiology, regulating in vitro differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). Here, we show that miR-125a-3p is upregulated in active lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and in OPCs isolated from the spinal cord of chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice, but not in those isolated from the spontaneously remyelinating corpus callosum of lysolecithin-treated mice. To test whether a sustained expression of miR-125a-3p in OPCs contribute to defective remyelination, we modulated miR-125a-3p expression in vivo and ex vivo after lysolecithin-induced demyelination. We found that lentiviral over-expression of miR-125a-3p impaired OPC maturation, whereas its downregulation accelerated remyelination. Transcriptome analysis and luciferase reporter assay revealed that these effects are partly mediated by the direct interaction of miR-125a-3p with Slc8a3, a sodium-calcium membrane transporter, and identified novel candidate targets, such as Gas7, that we demonstrated necessary to correctly address oligodendrocytes to terminal maturation. These findings show that miR-125a-3p upregulation negatively affects OPC maturation in vivo, suggest its role in the pathogenesis of demyelinating diseases and unveil new targets for future promyelinating protective interventions.", "50": "Remyelination, namely, the formation of new myelin sheaths around denuded axons, counteracts axonal degeneration and restores neuronal function. Considerable advances have been made in understanding this regenerative process that often fails in diseases like multiple sclerosis, leaving axons demyelinated and vulnerable to damage, thus contributing to disease progression. The identification of the membrane receptor GPR17 on a subset of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), which mediate remyelination in the adult central nervous system (CNS), has led to a huge amount of evidence that validated this receptor as a new attractive target for remyelinating therapies. Here, we summarize the role of GPR17 in OPC function, myelination and remyelination, describing its atypical pharmacology, its downstream signaling, and the genetic and epigenetic factors modulating its activity. We also highlight crucial insights into GPR17 pathophysiology coming from the demonstration that oligodendrocyte injury, associated with inflammation in chronic neurodegenerative conditions, is invariably characterized by abnormal and persistent GPR17 upregulation, which, in turn, is accompanied by a block of OPCs at immature premyelinating stages. Finally, we discuss the current literature in light of the potential exploitment of GPR17 as a therapeutic target to promote remyelination.", "51": "The presence of peripheral myelinating cells in the central nervous system (CNS) has gained the neurobiologist attention over the years. Despite the confirmed presence of Schwann cells in the CNS in pathological conditions, and the long list of their beneficial effects on central remyelination, the cues that impede or allow Schwann cells to successfully conquer and remyelinate central axons remain partially undiscovered. A better knowledge of these factors stands out as crucial to foresee a rational therapeutic approach for the use of Schwann cells in CNS repair. Here, we review the diverse origins of Schwann cells into the CNS, both peripheral and central, as well as the CNS components that inhibit Schwann survival and migration into the central parenchyma. Namely, we analyze the astrocyte- and the myelin-derived components that restrict Schwann cells into the CNS. Finally, we highlight the unveiled mode of invasion of these peripheral cells through the central environment, using blood vessels as scaffolds to pave their ways toward demyelinated lesions. In short, this review presents the so far uncovered knowledge of this complex CNS-peripheral nervous system (PNS) relationship.", "52": "Approximately 3% of the human genome is composed of short tandem repeat (STR) DNA sequence known as microsatellites, which can be found in both coding and non-coding regions. When associated with genic regions, expansion of microsatellite repeats beyond a critical threshold causes dozens of neurological repeat expansion disorders. To better understand the molecular pathology of repeat expansion disorders, precise cloning of microsatellite repeat sequence and expansion size is highly valuable. Unfortunately, cloning repeat expansions is often challenging and presents a significant bottleneck to practical investigation. Here, we describe a clear method for seamless and systematic cloning of practically any microsatellite repeat expansion. We use cloning and expansion of GGGGCC repeats, which are the leading genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), as an example. We employ a recursive directional ligation (RDL) technique to build multiple GGGGCC repeat-containing vectors. We describe methods to validate repeat expansion cloning, including diagnostic restriction digestion, PCR across the repeat, and next-generation long-read MinION nanopore sequencing. Validated cloning of microsatellite repeats beyond the critical expansion threshold can facilitate step-by-step characterization of disease mechanisms at the cellular and molecular level.", "53": "We aimed to describe website traffic and qualitatively analyze an e-health community discussion forum. Participants in this study were people affected by multiple sclerosis visiting the Overcoming Multiple Sclerosis (OMS) website. This mixed methods study combined descriptive analysis of website traffic over 7\u00a0years and 1\u00a0month, and qualitative analysis of 1\u00a0week of posts in the meditation topic, coded into theme groups using qualitative thematic analysis. There were 166 meditation topics posted with 21,530 initial views of primary post and 785 sub-post responses. Meditation posts and sub-posts received 368,713 replies. Number of views increased from 4,684 in 2011 to over 80,000 in 2017, a considerably greater rate of increase than overall traffic. Qualitative analysis of posts on the meditation forum identified themes of barriers and enablers to utilization of meditation resources. Enablement themes dominated, observed across six of the seven theme groups with various forms of positive social and emotional support to learn and practice meditation. One theme, negative emotion, was identified as a barrier.

About 25 year ago, a natural product, myriocin was isolated from culture broths of the fungus Isaria sinclairii. Myriocin, a rather complex amino acid having three successive asymmetric centers, was found to show a potent immunosuppressive activity in vitro; however, it induced a strong toxicity in vivo. To find out a less toxic immunosuppressive candidate, the chemical structure of myriocin was simplified to a nonchiral symmetric 2-substituted-2-aminoproane-1,3-diol framework. Finally, a highly potent immunosuppressant, fingolimod was found by the extensive chemical modification and pharmacological evaluation using skin allograft model in vivo. Throughout the analyses of the mechanism action of fingolimod, it is revealed that S1P receptor 1 (S1P<sub>1</sub>) plays an essential role in lymphocyte circulation and that the molecular target of fingolimod is S1P<sub>1</sub>. Phosphorylated fingolimod acts as a \"functional\" antagonist at S1P<sub>1</sub>, modulates lymphocyte circulation, and shows a potent immunosuppressive activity. Fingolimod significantly reduced the relapse rate of MS in the clinical studies and has been approved as a new therapeutic drug for MS in more than 80 countries.", "56": "Cannabinoids have been known as the primary component of cannabis for decades, but the characterization of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) in the 1990s opened the doors for cannabis' use in modern medicine. The 2 main receptors of this system, cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2, are found on cells of various tissues, with significant expression in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The characterization of the ECS also heralded the understanding of endocannabinoids, naturally occurring compounds synthesized in the human body. Via secondary signaling pathways acting on vagal nerves, nociceptors, and immune cells, cannabinoids have been shown to have both palliative and detrimental effects on the pathophysiology of GI disorders. Although research on the effects of both endogenous and exogenous cannabinoids has been slow due to the complicated legal history of cannabis, discoveries of cannabinoids' treatment potential have been found in various fields of medicine, including the GI world. Medical cannabis has since been offered as a treatment for a myriad of conditions and malignancies, including cancer, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, nausea, posttraumatic stress disorder, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cachexia, glaucoma, and epilepsy. This article hopes to create an overview of current research on cannabinoids and the ECS, detail the potential advantages and pitfalls of their use in GI diseases, and explore possible future developments in this field.", "57": "Recent studies have shown contribution of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the pathogenesis of immune-related disorders including multiple sclerosis (MS). Based on the role of these transcripts in the regulation of immune response, peripheral levels of lncRNAs can reflect the level of immune activation. In the present study, we quantified expression of four lncRNAs namely SPRY4-IT1, HOXA-AS2, LINC-ROR, and MEG3 in venous blood of MS patients and controls using quantitative real-time PCR method. Relative expressions of SPRY4-IT1, HOXA-AS2, LINC-ROR, and MEG3 were significantly lower in female MS patients compared with female healthy subjects. For MEG3, this pattern of expression was also observed in male subjects. However, for other lncRNAs, no significant difference was detected between male patients and male controls. Expression of HOXA-AS2 was correlated with progression index (r\u2009=\u20090.36, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Besides, there was a significant correlation between expression of this lncRNA and expression of LINC-ROR in MS patients (r\u2009=\u20090.44, P\u2009<\u20090.0001). There was no other correlation between expression of lncRNAs and clinical data in MS patients. In control group, expressions of none of lncRNAs were correlated with age of persons. Notably, significant correlations were demonstrated between expression levels of all lncRNAs in healthy subjects with r values ranging from 0.23 to 0.42. The current investigation shows dysregulation of lncRNAs in MS patients in a sex-specific manner and warrants further studies to unravel the clinical and therapeutic implications of such dysregulation.", "58": "Few tools are currently available to quantify gaze stability retraining exercises.

To explore this, we performed a histological, electrophysiological, and behavioral characterization of transgenic mice expressing a pathological form of human amyloid precursor protein (APP), containing three single point mutations associated with the development of familial Alzheimer's disease (PDGFB-APP<sup>Sw.Ind</sup> , also known as J20 mice). PDGFB-APP<sup>Sw.Ind</sup> transgenic mice had impaired survival from weaning, were hyperactive by 2\u00a0months of age, and developed amyloid plaques by 6\u00a0months of age, however, their spatial memory remained intact over this time course. Hippocampal OPC density was normal in P60-P180 PDGFB-APP<sup>Sw.Ind</sup> transgenic mice and, by performing whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, we found that their membrane properties, including their response to kainate (100\u00a0\u00b5M), were largely normal. However, by P100, the response of hippocampal OPCs to GABA was elevated in PDGFB-APP<sup>Sw.Ind</sup> transgenic mice. We also found that the nodes of Ranvier were shorter, the paranodes longer, and the myelin thicker for hippocampal axons in young adult PDGFB-APP<sup>Sw.Ind</sup> transgenic mice compared with wildtype littermates. Additionally, oligodendrogenesis was normal in young adulthood, but increased in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and fimbria of PDGFB-APP<sup>Sw.Ind</sup> transgenic mice as pathology developed. As the new oligodendrocytes were not associated with a change in total oligodendrocyte number, these cells are likely required for cell replacement.", "60": "The Stockwell Transform has the potential to perform multi-resolution texture analysis in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, it is computationally intensive and memory demanding. The polar Stockwell Transform (PST) is rotation-invariant and relatively memory efficient, but still computationally demanding. The new Discrete Orthogonal Stockwell Transform (DOST) appears to have addressed both the computation and storage challenges; however, its utility in localized texture analysis remains unclear. Our goal was to investigate the theory and texture analysis ability of the DOST versus PST using both synthetic and MR images, and explore the relative importance of the associated texture features using a simple classification example based on clinical brain MRI of six multiple sclerosis patients. MRI texture analysis focused on FLAIR images, and the classification used a machine learning algorithm, random forest, that differentiated regions of interest (ROIs) into 2 classes: white matter lesions, and the contralateral normal-appearing white matter (control). Our results showed that the PST features had a greater ability in detecting subtle changes in image structure than the DOST and polar-index DOST (PDOST). Quantitatively, based on 187 lesion and 187 control ROIs, both the PST and the rotation-invariant radial PST performed better in the classification than the DOST and PDOST, where the latter were no better than guessing (p\u00a0=\u00a00.65 and 0.98). Further analysis using a hierarchical random forest showed that combining MRI signal intensity with the PST or DOST predictions increased the classification performance, with the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity all improved to >85% in the tests. Collectively, the DOST is less competitive than the PST in localized image texture analysis. The PST features may help with texture-based lesion classification in MS based on clinical brain MRI scans following further verification.", "61": "Calibration of hyperpolarized <sup>13</sup> C-MRI is limited by the low signal from endogenous carbon-containing molecules and consequently requires <sup>13</sup> C-enriched external phantoms.

Beyond improving patient experience and reducing operational costs, faster scans are essential for time-sensitive imaging, such as fetal, cardiac, or functional MRI, where temporal resolution is important and target movement is unavoidable, yet must be reduced. Current MRI acquisition methods speed up scan time at the expense of lower spatial resolution and costlier hardware. We introduce a practical, software-only framework, based on deep learning, for accelerating MRI acquisition, while maintaining anatomically meaningful imaging. This is accomplished by MRI subsampling followed by estimating the missing k-space samples via generative adversarial neural networks. A generator-discriminator interplay enables the introduction of an adversarial cost in addition to fidelity and image-quality losses used for optimizing the reconstruction. Promising reconstruction results are obtained from feasible sampling patterns of up to a fivefold acceleration of diverse brain MRIs, from a large publicly available dataset of healthy adult scans as well as multimodal acquisitions of multiple sclerosis patients and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) sequences of stroke and tumor patients. Clinical usability of the reconstructed MRI scans is assessed by performing either lesion or healthy tissue segmentation and comparing the results to those obtained by using the original, fully sampled images. Reconstruction quality and usability of the DCE-MRI sequences is demonstrated by calculating the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters. The proposed MRI reconstruction approach is shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods for all datasets tested in terms of the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), the structural similarity index (SSIM), as well as either the mean squared error (MSE) with respect to the PK parameters, calculated for the fully sampled DCE-MRI sequences, or the segmentation compatibility, measured in terms of Dice scores and Hausdorff distance. The code is available on GitHub.", "64": "Over the past few decades several attempts have been made to introduce a potential and promising therapy for Multiple sclerosis (MS). Calorie restriction (CR) is a dietary manipulation to reduce calorie intake which has been shown to improve neuroprotection and attenuate neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we evaluated the effect of 33% CR regimen for 4 weeks on the remyelination capacity of Cuprizone (CPZ) induced demyelination in a mouse model of MS. Results showed that CR induced a significant increase in motor coordination and balance performance in CPZ mice. Also, luxol fast blue (LFB) staining showed that CR regimen significantly improved the remyelination in the corpus callosum of CPZ\u2009+\u2009CR mice compared to the CPZ group. In addition, CR regimen significantly increased the transcript expression levels of BDNF, Sox2, and Sirt1 in the corpus callosum of CPZ mice, while decreasing the p53 levels. Moreover, CR regimen significantly decreased the apoptosis rate. Furthermore, astrogliosis (GFAP\u2009+\u2009astrocytes) and microgliosis (Iba-1\u2009+\u2009microglia) were significantly decreased by CR regimen while oligodendrogenesis (Olig2+) and Sirt1\u2009+\u2009cell expression were significantly increased in the corpus callosum of CPZ\u2009+\u2009CR mice compared to the CPZ group. In conclusion, CR regimen can promote remyelination potential in a CPZ-demyelinating mouse model of MS by increasing oligodendrocyte generation while decreasing their apoptosis.", "65": "The sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) is an important biomarker for imaging inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS).

MS/EAE are triggered by encephalitogenic immune cells, including Th1 and Th17 cells, whereas T regulatory (Treg) cells are involved in inflammation resolution. Pro-inflammatory macrophages/microglia also play a deleterious role in the disease. Seasonal variations in MS relapses, active lesions, and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels have been described in MS patients and have been related with both perinatal and adult exposure to sunlight and other environmental factors. However, some data in EAE mice suggest that these variations might be, at least partially, endogenously determined. Thus, our objective was to study the effect of the season of birth and disease induction on the course of EAE, and immune cell infiltration in the central nervous system (CNS) in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG<sub>35-55</sub>)-induced EAE in 8\u00a0weeks old, female C57BL/6N mice maintained under constant, controlled conditions. EAE severity as well as pathogenic (Th1, Th17, macrophages/microglia) and protective (Treg) subsets was found to vary according to the season of birth or of EAE induction. Summer-born or summer-immunized animals developed a milder disease, which coincided with variations in numbers of T effector/regulatory subsets, and significantly low numbers of macrophages/microglia. These results suggest that endogenous rhythms in immune responses might cause seasonal variations in EAE severity, and, maybe, in the course of MS, and that they might be related to macrophages/microglia.", "67": "Accumulating evidence suggests that platelet-activating factor (PAF) increases the inflammatory response in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. However, PAF receptor (PAFR) antagonists do not show therapeutic efficacy for MS, and its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the effects of PAF on an ex vivo demyelination cerebellar model following lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC, 0.5\u00a0mg/mL) application using wild-type and PAFR conventional knockout (PAFR-KO) mice. Demyelination was induced in cerebellar slices that were cultured with LPC for 18\u00a0h. Exogenous PAF (1\u00a0\u03bcM) acting on cerebellar slices alone did not cause demyelination but increased the severity of LPC-induced demyelination in both wild-type and PAFR-KO mice. LPC inhibited the expression of PAF-AH, MBP, TNF-\u03b1, and TGF-\u03b21 but facilitated the expression of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 in wild-type preparations. Of note, exogenous PAF stimulated microglial activation in both wild-type and PAFR-KO mice. The subsequent inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 as well as the anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-\u03b21 demonstrated a diverse transcriptional profile with or without LPC treatment. PAF promoted TNF-\u03b1 expression and suppressed TGF-\u03b21 expression indiscriminately in wild-type and knockout slices; however, transcription of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 was not significantly affected in both slices. The syntheses of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 were significantly increased in LPC-induced demyelination preparations without PAF but showed a redundancy in PAF-treated wild-type and knockout slices. These data suggest that PAF can play a detrimental role in LPC-induced demyelination probably due to a redundant response of PAFR-dependent and PAFR-independent effects on inflammatory cytokines.", "68": "Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system characterized by pronounced inflammatory infiltrates entering the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve leading to demyelination. Focal demyelination is associated with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, while progressive forms of the disease show axonal degeneration and neuronal loss. The tests currently used in the clinical diagnosis and management of multiple sclerosis have limitations due to specificity and sensitivity. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are dysregulated in many diseases and disorders including demyelinating and neuroinflammatory diseases. A review of recent studies with the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis animal model (mostly female mice 6-12 weeks of age) has confirmed miRNAs as biomarkers of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis disease and importantly at the pre-onset (asymptomatic) stage when assessed in blood plasma and urine exosomes, and spinal cord tissue. The expression of certain miRNAs was also dysregulated at the onset and peak of disease in blood plasma and urine exosomes, brain and spinal cord tissue, and at the post-peak (chronic) stage of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis disease in spinal cord tissue. Therapies using miRNA mimics or inhibitors were found to delay the induction and alleviate the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis disease. Interestingly, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis disease severity was reduced by overexpression of miR-146a, miR-23b, miR-497, miR-26a, and miR-20b, or by suppression of miR-182, miR-181c, miR-223, miR-155, and miR-873. Further studies are warranted on determining more fully miRNA profiles in blood plasma and urine exosomes of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis animals since they could serve as biomarkers of asymptomatic multiple sclerosis and disease course. Additionally, studies should be performed with male mice of a similar age, and with aged male and female mice.", "69": "Fampridine is the only drug approved for the treatment of walking impairment in multiple sclerosis. Around a third of the patients on treatment obtained an improvement in walking speed during the development phase.

In the real-world setting, the number of patients with a significant response to the treatment seems to be higher (around 70%). The tolerance is good, with mild to moderate, and transient adverse events. The most commonly reported are insomnia, headache, fatigue, back pain, dizziness, nausea and balance disorders.

The levels of its active metabolite, monomethyl fumarate, are bioequivalent to the levels generated from dimethyl fumarate (DMF) treatment. The efficacy and safety profiles of DRF are expected to be similar to the well-established profiles of DMF. The metabolism of DRF leads to lower concentration of methanol in the small intestine than with DMF and thus reduced severity and frequency of gastrointestinal adverse events. DRF seems a promising alternative to DMF and other first-line therapies for multiple sclerosis. The current review is based on the two existing Phase III trials of DRF: the interim analysis of the EVOLVE-MS-1 trial and the completed EVOLVE-MS-2 trial.", "71": "Demyelination is the key pathological process in multiple sclerosis (MS). The extent of demyelination can be quantified with magnetic resonance imaging by assessing the myelin water fraction (MWF). However, long computation times and high noise sensitivity hinder the translation of MWF imaging to clinical practice. In this work, we introduce a more efficient and noise robust method to determine the MWF using a joint sparsity constraint and a pre-computed B<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup>-T<sub>2</sub> dictionary. A single component analysis with this dictionary is used in an initial step to obtain a B<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> map. The T<sub>2</sub> distribution is then determined from a reduced dictionary corresponding to the estimated B<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> map using a combination of a non-negativity and a joint sparsity constraint. The non-negativity constraint ensures that a feasible solution with non-negative contribution of each T<sub>2</sub> component is obtained. The joint sparsity constraint restricts the T<sub>2</sub> distribution to a small set of T<sub>2</sub> relaxation times shared between all voxels and reduces the noise sensitivity. The applied Sparsity Promoting Iterative Joint NNLS (SPIJN) algorithm can be implemented efficiently, reducing the computation time by a factor of 50 compared to the commonly used regularized non-negative least squares algorithm. The proposed method was validated in simulations and in 8 healthy subjects with a 3D multi-echo gradient- and spin echo scan at 3\u00a0\u200bT. In simulations, the absolute error in the MWF decreased from 0.031 to 0.013 compared to the regularized NNLS algorithm for SNR\u00a0\u200b=\u00a0\u200b250. The in vivo results were consistent with values reported in literature and improved MWF-quantification was obtained especially in the frontal white matter. The maximum standard deviation in mean MWF in different regions of interest between subjects was smaller for the proposed method (0.0193) compared to the regularized NNLS algorithm (0.0266). In conclusion, the proposed method for MWF estimation is less computationally expensive and less susceptible to noise compared to state of the art methods. These improvements might be an important step towards clinical translation of MWF measurements.", "72": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune, neuroinflammatory, and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system.

In this study, a 3D inversion recovery-prepared ultrashort echo time cones (IR-UTE-Cones) sequence was used for both morphological and quantitative imaging of myelin on a clinical 3 T scanner. Myelin powder phantoms with different myelin concentrations were imaged with the 3D UTE-Cones sequence and it showed a strong correlation between concentrations and UTE-Cones signals, demonstrating the ability of the UTE-Cones sequence to directly image myelin in the brain. Quantitative myelin imaging with multi-echo IR-UTE-Cones sequences show similar T<sub>2</sub> * values for a D<sub>2</sub> O-exchanged myelin phantom (T<sub>2</sub> * = 0.33 \u00b1 0.04 ms), ex vivo brain specimens (T<sub>2</sub> * = 0.20 \u00b1 0.04 ms) and in vivo healthy volunteers (T<sub>2</sub> * = 0.254 \u00b1 0.023 ms), further confirming the feasibility of 3D IR-UTE-Cones sequences for direct myelin imaging in vivo. In ex vivo MS brain study, signal loss is observed in MS lesions, which was confirmed with histology. For the in vivo study, the lesions in MS patients also show myelin signal loss using the proposed direct myelin imaging method, demonstrating the clinical potential for MS diagnosis. Furthermore, the measured IR-UTE-Cones signal intensities show a significant difference between normal-appearing white matter in MS patients and normal white matter in volunteers, which cannot be found in clinical used T<sub>2</sub> -FLAIR sequences.

Since the introduction of the first statin, lovastatin, in 1987, accumulating evidence showed that non-cholesterol lowering effects play an important role in their efficacy to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Thus, these non-LDL-c lowering properties could benefit patients with immune-mediated diseases. Statins and their associated immune-modulating roles have recently received much attention. Different statins have been administered in various experimental and clinical studies focused on autoimmunity. The results indicate that statins can modulate immune responses through mevalonate pathway-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating effects include cell adhesion, migration of antigen presenting cells, and differentiation, as well as activation, of T-cells.

ApoD is a multi-ligand, multi-function protein that is involved lipid trafficking, food intake, inflammation, antioxidative response and development and in different types of cancers. An important aspect of ApoD's role in lipid metabolism appears to involve the transport of arachidonic acid, and the modulation of eicosanoid production and delivery in metabolic tissues. ApoD expression in metabolic tissues has been associated positively and negatively with insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis in a tissue dependent manner. ApoD levels rise considerably in association with aging and neuropathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke, meningoencephalitis, moto-neuron disease, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease.

However, delayed tPA administration is associated with increased risk of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and hemorrhagic transformation (HT). Interferon-\u03b2 (IFN\u03b2), an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, is a cytokine with immunomodulatory properties. Previous studies, including ours, demonstrated that IFN\u03b2 or type I IFN receptor signaling conferred protection against ischemic stroke in preclinical models, suggesting IFN\u03b2 might have translational therapeutic potential for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Currently, whether IFN\u03b2 could be coadministered with tPA to alleviate delayed tPA-induced adverse effects remains unknown. To elucidate that, IFN\u03b2 was coadministered with delayed tPA to ischemic stroke animals, and the severity and pathology of ischemic brain injury were assessed. We found delayed tPA treatment exacerbated ischemic brain injury, manifested by aggravated BBB disruption and HT. Notably, IFN\u03b2 ameliorated delayed tPA-exacerbated brain injury and alleviated adverse effects. Mechanistic studies revealed IFN\u03b2 suppressed tPA-enhanced neuroinflammation and MMP3/9 production in the ischemic brain. Furthermore, we identified IFN\u03b2 suppressed MMP9 production in microglia and attenuated tight junction protein degradation in brain endothelial cells. Moreover, we observed that peripheral immune cells may participate to a lesser extent in delayed tPA-exacerbated brain injury during the early phase of ischemic stroke. In conclusion, we provide the first evidence that IFN\u03b2 can be coadministered with tPA to mitigate delayed tPA-induced adverse effects of BBB disruption and HT that could potentially extend the tPA therapeutic window for the treatment of ischemic stroke.", "85": "Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic imaging is a powerful technique for molecular imaging of pathologies associated with the nervous systems including multiple sclerosis research. However, there is no standard methodology or standardized protocol for FTIR imaging of tissue sections that maximize the ability to discriminate between the molecular, white and granular layers, which is essential in the investigation of the mechanism of demyelination process. Tissue sections are heterogeneous, complex and delicate, hence the parameters to generate high quality images in minimal time becomes essential in the modern clinical laboratory. This article presents an FTIR spectroscopic imaging study of post-mortem human brain tissue testing the effects of various measurement parameters and data analysis methods on image quality and acquisition time. Hyperspectral images acquired from the same region of a tissue using a range of the most common optical and collection parameters in different combinations were compared. These included magnification (4\u00d7 and 15\u00d7), number of co-added scans (1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 scans) and spectral resolution (4, 8 and 16 cm-1). Images were compared in terms of acquisition time, signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio, and accuracy of the discrimination between three major tissue types in a section from the cerebellum (white matter, granular and molecular layers). In the latter case, unsupervised k-means cluster (KMC) analysis was employed to generate images from the hyperspectral images, which were compared to a reference image. The classification accuracy for tissue class discrimination was highest for the 4\u00d7 magnifying objective, with 4 cm-1 spectral resolution and 128 co-added scans. The 15\u00d7 magnifying objective gave the best accuracy for a spectral resolution of 4 cm-1 and 64 scans (96.3%), which was just above what was achieved using the 4\u00d7 magnifying objective, with 4 cm-1 spectral resolution and 32 and 64 co-added scans (95.4 and 95.6%, respectively). These findings were correlated with a decrease in S/N ratio with increasing number of scans and was generally lower for the 15\u00d7 objective. However, longer scan times were required using the 15\u00d7 magnifying objective, which did not justify the very small improvement in the classification of tissue types.", "86": "Gene therapy is one the frontier fields of medical breakthroughs that poses as an effective solution to previously incurable diseases. The delivery of the corrective genetic material or a therapeutic gene into the cell restores the missing gene function and cures a plethora of diseases, incurable by the conventional medical approaches. This discovery holds the potential to treat many neurodegenerative disorders such as muscular atrophy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) among others. Gene therapy proves as a humane, cost effective alternative to the exhaustive often arduous and timely impossible process of finding matched donors and extensive surgery. It also overcomes the shortcoming of conventional methods to cross the blood brain barrier. However, the use of gene therapy is only possible after procuring the in-depth knowledge of the immuno-pathogenesis and molecular mechanism of the disease. The process of gene therapy can be broadly categorized into three main steps: elucidating the target gene, culling the appropriate vector, and determining the best mode of transfer; each step mandating pervasive research.

We implemented a mouse model recapitulating more closely the human pathology as it is characterized by both an autoimmune heterogeneity and the presence of cortical lesions, two parameters missing in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. In our model, mice clustered in two groups displaying high or low clinical scores. Upon cortical cytokine injection, lesions appeared with a specific topography while cortical miRNA profiles were altered. These two features differed according to disease severity. We evidenced changes in miRNA regulators and targets suggesting that miRNA alteration had functional repercussions that could explain the differences in cortical lesions. This model represents a crucial tool for the study of both miRNA involvement and cortical lesion formation in disease pathogenesis.", "89": "Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) are at increased risk of infection.

A modified Delphi consensus process was conducted to develop clinically relevant, evidence-based recommendations to assist physicians with decision-making in relation to the risks of a wide range of infections associated with different DMDs in patients with MS. The current consensus statements, developed by a panel of experts (neurologists, infectious disease specialists, a gynaecologist and a neuroradiologist), address the risk of iatrogenic infections (opportunistic infections, including herpes and cryptococcal infections, candidiasis and listeria; progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; human papillomavirus and urinary tract infections; respiratory tract infections and tuberculosis; hepatitis and gastrointestinal infections) in patients with MS treated with different DMDs, as well as prevention strategies and surveillance strategies for the early identification of infections. In the discussion, more recent data emerged in the literature were taken into consideration. Recommended risk reduction and management strategies for infections include screening at diagnosis and before starting a new DMD, prophylaxis where appropriate, monitoring and early diagnosis.", "91": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that mostly affects younger adults. However, the first symptoms of MS can appear in children and adolescents before the age of 18, and we call this paediatric MS (PMS). It is estimated that paediatric MS accounts for 3-5% of the general population of patients with MS. Despite the fundamental si-milarities to adult MS, PMS has many distinctive features. Paediatric MS has a milder course compared to adults, but leads to sig-nificant disability at an early age. PMS is relapsing-remitting in 95-98% of cases; the primary progressive manifestation is much less common than in adults. The differential diagnosis of MS in children should include other childhood demyelinating diseases, mitochondrial and metabolic diseases, connective tissue diseases, and neuroborreliosis. Differentiating acute disseminated en-cephalomyelitis (ADEM) from the first onset of MS remains the biggest challenge. Over the past 10 years, understanding of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of MS in children has significantly expanded. The diagnostic criteria leading to earlier diagnosis and initiation of disease-modifying therapy (DMT) have changed, and the number of drugs used in children has increased. However, many important issues require further research. This review discusses the current state of knowledge regarding the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of multiple sclerosis in children.", "92": "Citrullination is a post-translational modification implicated in various human diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and cancers. Due to a relatively low concentration of citrullinated proteins in the total proteome, confident identification of citrullinated proteome is challenging in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic analysis. From these MS-based analyses, MS features that characterize citrullination, such as immonium ions (IMs) and neutral losses (NLs), called diagnostic ions, have been reported. However, there has been a lack of systematic approaches to comprehensively search for diagnostic ions and no statistical methods for the identification of citrullinated proteome based on these diagnostic ions. Here, we present a systematic approach to identify diagnostic IMs, internal ions (INTs), and NLs for citrullination from tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra. Diagnostic INTs mainly consisted of internal fragment ions for di- and tripeptides that contained two and three amino acids with at least one citrullinated arginine, respectively. A statistical logistic regression model was built for a confident assessment of citrullinated peptides that database searches identified (true positives) and prediction of citrullinated peptides that database searches failed to identify (false negatives) using the diagnostic IMs, INTs, and NLs. Applications of our model to complex global proteome data sets demonstrated the increased accuracy in the identification of citrullinated peptides, thereby enhancing the size and functional interpretation of citrullinated proteomes.", "93": "An ever-expanding number of disease-modifying drugs for multiple sclerosis have become available in recent years, after demonstrating efficacy in clinical trials. In the real-world setting, however, disease-modifying drugs are prescribed in patient populations that differ from those included in pivotal studies, where extreme age patients are usually excluded or under-represented. In this multicentre, observational, retrospective Italian cohort study, we evaluated treatment exposure in three cohorts of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis defined by age at onset: paediatric-onset (\u226418 years), adult-onset (18-49 years) and late-onset multiple sclerosis (\u226550 years). We included patients with a relapsing-remitting phenotype, \u22655 years follow-up, \u22653 Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) evaluations and a first neurological evaluation within 3 years from the first demyelinating event. Multivariate Cox regression models (adjusted hazard ratio with 95% con\ufb01dence intervals) were used to assess the risk of reaching a first 12-month confirmed disability worsening and the risk of reaching a sustained EDSS of 4.0. The effect of disease-modifying drugs was assessed as quartiles of time exposure. We found that disease-modifying drugs reduced the risk of 12-month confirmed disability worsening, with a progressive risk reduction in different quartiles of exposure in paediatric-onset and adult-onset patients [adjusted hazard ratios in non-exposed versus exposed >62% of the follow-up time: 8.0 (3.5-17.9) for paediatric-onset and 6.3 (4.9-8.0) for adult-onset, P\u2009<\u20090.0001] showing a trend in late-onset patients [adjusted hazard ratio = 1.9 (0.9-4.1), P\u2009=\u20090.07]. These results were confirmed for a sustained EDSS score of 4.0. We also found that relapses were a risk factor for 12-month confirmed disability worsening in all three cohorts, and female sex exerted a protective role in the late-onset cohort. This study provides evidence that sustained exposure to disease-modifying drugs decreases the risk of disability accumulation, seemingly in a dose-dependent manner. It confirms that the effectiveness of disease-modifying drugs is lower in late-onset patients, although still detectable.", "94": "We used 7 T MRI to: (i) characterize the grey and white matter pathology in the cervical spinal cord of patients with early relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis; (ii) assess the spinal cord lesion spatial distribution and the hypothesis of an outside-in pathological process possibly driven by CSF-mediated immune cytotoxic factors; and (iii) evaluate the association of spinal cord pathology with brain burden and its contribution to neurological disability. We prospectively recruited 20 relapsing-remitting, 15 secondary progressive multiple sclerosis participants and 11 age-matched healthy control subjects to undergo 7 T imaging of the cervical spinal cord and brain as well as conventional 3 T brain acquisition. Cervical spinal cord imaging at 7 T was used to segment grey and white matter, including lesions therein. Brain imaging at 7 T was used to segment cortical and white matter lesions and 3 T imaging for cortical thickness estimation. Cervical spinal cord lesions were mapped voxel-wise as a function of distance from the inner central canal CSF pool to the outer subpial surface. Similarly, brain white matter lesions were mapped voxel-wise as a function of distance from the ventricular system. Subjects with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis showed a greater predominance of spinal cord lesions nearer the outer subpial surface compared to secondary progressive cases. Inversely, secondary progressive participants presented with more centrally located lesions. Within the brain, there was a strong gradient of lesion formation nearest the ventricular system that was most evident in participants with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Lesion fractions within the spinal cord grey and white matter were related to the lesion fraction in cerebral white matter. Cortical thinning was the primary determinant of the Expanded Disability Status Scale, white matter lesion fractions in the spinal cord and brain of the 9-Hole Peg Test and cortical thickness and spinal cord grey matter cross-sectional area of the Timed 25-Foot Walk. Spinal cord lesions were localized nearest the subpial surfaces for those with relapsing-remitting and the central canal CSF surface in progressive disease, possibly implying CSF-mediated pathogenic mechanisms in lesion development that may differ between multiple sclerosis subtypes. These findings show that spinal cord lesions involve both grey and white matter from the early multiple sclerosis stages and occur mostly independent from brain pathology. Despite the prevalence of cervical spinal cord lesions and atrophy, brain pathology seems more strongly related to physical disability as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale.", "95": "Imaging methods bring new possibilities for describing the brain plasticity processes that underly the improvement of clinical function after physiotherapy in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS).

Our study examines the changes to the gut microbiome that occur during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for MS. We collected fecal samples at key stages of EAE progression and quantified microbial abundances with 16S V3-V4 amplicon sequencing. Our analysis of the data suggests that the abundance of commensal Lactobacillaceae decreases during EAE while other commensal populations belonging to the Clostridiaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Peptostreptococcaceae families expand. Community analysis with microbial co-occurrence networks points to these three expanding taxa as potential mediators of gut microbiome dysbiosis. We also employed PICRUSt2 to impute MetaCyc Enzyme Consortium (EC) pathway abundances from the original microbial abundance data. From this analysis, we found that a number of imputed EC pathways responsible for the production of immunomodulatory compounds appear to be enriched in mice undergoing EAE. Our analysis and interpretation of results provides a detailed picture of the changes to the gut microbiome that are occurring throughout the course of EAE disease progression and helps to evaluate EAE as a viable model for gut dysbiosis in MS patients.", "100": "Although previous studies have shown that intra-network abnormalities in brain functional networks are correlated with clinical/cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS), there is little information regarding the pattern of causal interactions among cognition-related resting-state networks (RSNs) in different disease stages of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients.

Efficient extraction of lipids from the biological matrix is a crucial step in the analytical workflow. Whereas numerous applications of classical and more recently published extraction methods have been reported for blood serum or plasma samples, very little is known about the applicability of these methods for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF though represents a highly interesting biofluid for the investigation of neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or brain cancer. Since CSF comprises substantially lower endogenous lipid concentrations compared to serum or plasma, the use of highly efficient extraction methods is of utmost importance. In addition, literature on lipid extraction methods is often inconsistent in terms of methodological parameters like temperature, mixing times, or the number of repeated extraction cycles. In this study, four liquid-liquid extraction methods (Folch, Bligh & Dyer, MTBE and BUME) and one protein precipitation method (MMC method) were evaluated using a pooled CSF sample, followed by the investigation of key process parameters (temperature and mixing times) and modifications of the most promising methods, in order to achieve a broad coverage of lipid classes as well as high recoveries and repeatabilities. A modified Folch method turned out as most suitable for the efficient extraction of a broad range of lipid classes from CSF including glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids and sphingolipids. In addition, using cooled solvents and equipment was shown to significantly improve lipid extraction efficiencies. Mixing times should be thoroughly optimized for the lipid classes of interest in order to achieve high recoveries without lipid degradation due to unnecessarily long mixing. Finally, acidification led to improved extraction efficiency for acidic glycerophospholipids.", "105": "Wearable powered robotic exoskeleton can provide high repetitions and high-intensity gait training.

Considering ALS patients undergo these same pathological changes, IL6 levels may be relevant for prognostication and treatment. The amount of soluble IL6 receptor, dictated by the IL6R<sup>358</sup>Ala variant, and local tissue environment in which IL6 signaling occurs is known to influence the ultimate effects of IL6 in multiple diseases. In this longitudinal study, we show that serum IL6 levels negatively correlate both with the patient's functional status as measured by the overall ALSFRS-R and subscores, and with respiratory function as measured by the percent predicted FVC (ppFVC). The correlations are only present in the two-thirds of patients who carry the IL6R<sup>358</sup>Ala variant that mediates pro-inflammatory transsignaling in the cases of ALSFRS-R limb and respiratory subscores and ppFVC. These results suggest that some observed associations between IL6 and ALS are driven by the subset of patients carrying the IL6R<sup>358</sup>Ala variant and thus that any IL6-targeted therapeutic approaches may be more advantageous when aimed at this group. Specifically, with relation to respiratory decline, these patients may benefit from closer respiratory follow-up and early initiation of noninvasive ventilation.", "108": "- The NMDA receptor is implicated in various diseases including neurodegenerative, neurodevelopmental and mood disorders.

We found that KD treatment significantly elevated the level of serum \u03b2-hydroxybutyric acid and improved behavioral, motor abnormalities, impaired spatial learning and memory of CPZ-induced demyelination mice. Meanwhile, KD lessened the hippocampal demyelination by enhancing the expression of mature oligodendrocytes (OLs), which was revealed by the elevated expression of MBP and CNPase, as well as the luxol fast blue-staining intensity. Furthermore, KD inhibits the activation of microglia (especially M1-liked microglia) and reactive astrocytes. Interestingly, KD attenuated the CPZ-induced oxidative stress by decreasing the malondialdehyde (MDA) content and restoring the glutathione (GSH) levels. In addition, the double immunofluorescence staining revealed that KD enhanced the expression of SIRT1 in astrocytes, microglia and mature oligodendrocytes. Concomitantly, western blot demonstrated that KD increased the expression of SIRT1, phosphorylated-AKT, mTOR and PPAR-\u03b3.

BBB dysfunction is reported in many CNS diseases, such cognitive impairment, depression, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Emerging evidence indicates that liver-derived inflammatory mediators are upregulated in neurological diseases with BBB dysfunction. Serum amyloid A (SAA), an acute phase protein secreted by hepatocytes, could be a candidate inflammatory signaling molecule transmitted from the liver to the brain; however, its contribution to BBB dysfunction is poorly understood. The present study aimed to elucidate the involvement of SAA in BBB impairment in an in vitro BBB model using rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (RBECs). We demonstrated that Apo-SAA significantly decreased transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and increased sodium fluorescein (Na-F) permeability in RBEC monolayers. Apo-SAA also decreased claudin-5 expression levels in RBECs. Furthermore, the Apo-SAA-mediated impairment of the BBB with decreased claudin-5 expression was inhibited by the addition of a high-density lipoprotein (HDL) related to SAA in plasma. These findings suggest that HDL counteracts the effects of SAA on BBB function. Therefore, the functional imbalance between SAA and HDL may induce BBB impairment, thereby triggering development of neuroinflammation.

We investigated the impact of <i>Tsc1</i> inactivation in murine bone marrow (BM)-MSCs, using tissue-specific, transgelin (<i>Tagln</i>)-mediated cre-recombination, targeting both BM-MSCs and smooth muscle cells. <i>Tsc1</i> mutants were viable, but homozygous inactivation led to a dwarfed appearance with TSC-like pathologies in multiple organs and reduced survival.

The hyperproliferative BM-MSC phenotype was lost in aged (1.5 yr) mice, and <i>Tsc1</i> inactivation was also accompanied by elevated ROS and increased senescence. ShRNA-mediated knockdown of <i>Tsc1</i> in BM-MSCs replicated the hyperproliferative BM-MSC phenotype and led to impaired adipogenic and myogenic differentiation.

The purpose of this qualitative descriptive study was to explore the experience of participating in an online or traditional onsite 8-week, once a week, Mind Body Stress Reduction combined with Sleep Retraining course among women living with MS to establish online course acceptability. Braun and Clarke's Reflexive Thematic Analysis method was used to analyze focus group interview data. Time and length for both courses was found acceptable, camaraderie and interconnectedness were essential, having choice regarding course delivery format was important, and being provided with organized learning materials at the course start in a binder or packet was considered imperative. Acceptability was established for both the online and onsite formats.", "139": "Multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease of central nervous system (CNS), is associated with damage to the myelin sheath of neurons.

Binding of vitamin D to its specific nuclear receptors is way to exert its function.", "140": "Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that produce energy and molecular precursors that are essential for myelin synthesis. Unlike in neurons, mitochondria in oligodendrocytes increase intracellular movement in response to glutamatergic activation and are more susceptible to oxidative stress than in astrocytes or microglia. The signaling pathways that regulate these cell type-specific mitochondrial responses in oligodendrocytes are not understood. Here, we visualized mitochondria migrating through thin cytoplasmic channels crossing myelin basic protein-positive compacted membranes and localized within paranodal loop cytoplasm. We hypothesized that local extracellular enrichment of netrin-1 might regulate the recruitment and function of paranodal proteins and organelles, including mitochondria. We identified rapid recruitment of mitochondria and paranodal proteins, including neurofascin 155 (NF155) and the netrin receptor deleted in colorectal carcinoma (DCC), to sites of contact between oligodendrocytes and netrin-1-coated microbeads in vitro. We provide evidence that Src-family kinase activation and Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibition downstream of netrin-1 induces mitochondrial elongation, hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial inner membrane, and increases glycolysis. Our findings identify a signaling mechanism in oligodendrocytes that is sufficient to locally recruit paranodal proteins and regulate the subcellular localization, morphology, and function of mitochondria.", "141": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex inflammatory disease in which demyelination occurs in the central nervous system affecting approximately 2.5 million people worldwide. Recent reports have shown that the gut microbiome plays a crucial role in the functioning of the immune system in inflammatory diseases such as MS. In this study, the cuprizone-induced demyelination mouse model was used to investigate the effect of Lactobacillus casei strain T2 (IBRC-M10783) on the alleviation of these mice. Female C57BL/6 mice (8-10\u00a0weeks old) were divided into 6 groups: group 1, normal control; group 2, cuprizone control (oral administration of cuprizone 0.2% w/w for 4\u00a0weeks); group 3, probiotic control (oral administration of 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>9</sup>\u00a0CFU/ml probiotic for 4\u00a0weeks); group 4, treatment 1 (probiotic for 4\u00a0weeks then cuprizone for 4\u00a0weeks); group 5, treatment 2 (cuprizone for 4\u00a0weeks then probiotic for 4\u00a0weeks); and group 6, treatment 3 (cuprizone for 4\u00a0weeks then probiotic for 4\u00a0weeks with vitamin D<sub>3</sub> at a dose of 20\u00a0IU/day). Then, TGF-\u03b2 and IL-17 were measured by ELISA, and the expression of miR-155, miR-25, and IDO-1 was evaluated by real-time PCR. Among the measured microRNAs, the results showed that there was a significant decrease in miR-155 expression between the treatment 1 group and the cuprizone group. In the case of IL-17, the results also showed a significant reduction between the three treatment groups and the cuprizone group. These observations suggest that L. casei can reduce proinflammatory cytokines and reduce demyelinating symptoms in the mouse model.", "142": "In Hebrew online health communities, participants commonly write medical terms that appear as transliterated forms of a source term in English. Such transliterations introduce high variability in text and challenge text-analytics methods.

The complicated interaction between nutrition and immunity has drawn wide attention in recent years. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of intermittent caloric restriction on autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis, in mice. EAE was induced by immunization of C57BL/6 mice with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55 peptide. After the EAE symptoms became obvious at the 4th week post-immunization, the mice were administered with a modified fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) at 1/3 cal of control for 3 days, followed by ad libitum with normal chow for 4 days. A total of two cycles of FMD was applied. Compared with the mice without receiving caloric restriction, the mice using FMD had significant decreases in EAE severity, immune cell infiltration in spinal cord and CNS demyelination. FMD administration also reversed EAE-mediated CNS accumulation of total CD4+ T cells and in particular, IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4+ T cells. Moreover, FMD application elevated the cell proliferation rate in CNS and enhanced expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and remyelination markers. In conclusion, our results indicate that intermittent caloric restriction using the modified FMD was effective in the treatment of EAE through ameliorating inflammatory response and promoting recovery of the damaged tissue.", "144": "The presence of co-existent neuronal antibodies (neuronal-IgG) in patients with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein immunoglobulin G (MOG-IgG1) is not yet well understood.", "145": "Depression is frequently associated with multiple sclerosis (MS).

Although some growth factors improve this repair, unspecific delivery to cells and potential side effects limit their therapeutic use. Thus, NFL-TBS.40-63 peptide (NFL)-known to enter specifically myelinating oligodendrocytes (OL)-was used to vectorize 100\u00a0nm diameter lipid nanoparticles (LNC), and the ability of NFL-LNC to specifically target OL from newborn rat brain was assessed in vitro. Specific uptake of DiD-labeled NFL-LNC by OL characterized by CNP and myelin basic protein was observed by confocal microscopy, as well as DiD colocalization with NFL and with Rab5-a marker of early endosomes. Unvectorized LNC did not significantly penetrate OL and there was no uptake of NFL-LNC by astrocytes. Canonical maturation of OL which extended compacted myelin-like membranes was observed by transmission electron microscopy in cells grown up to 9\u00a0days with NFL-LNC. Endocytosis of NFL-LNC appeared to depend on several pathways, as demonstrated by inhibitors. In addition, vectorized NFL-LNC adsorbed on neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) potentiated the proremyelinating effects of NT-3 after demyelination by lysophosphatidyl choline, allowing noticeably decreasing NT-3 concentration. Our results if they were confirmed in vivo suggest that NFL-vectorized LNC appear safe and could be considered as putative carriers for specific drug delivery to OL in order to increase remyelination.", "148": "We aimed to characterize cortical macro- and micro-structure of behavioral and cognitive changes along the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) - frontotemporal dementia (FTD) continuum.", "149": "Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is an important lipid biomolecule that exerts pleiotropic cellular actions as it binds to and activates its five G-protein-coupled receptors, S1P<sub>1-5</sub>. Through these receptors, S1P can mediate diverse biological activities in both healthy and diseased conditions. S1P is produced by S1P-producing enzymes, sphingosine kinases (SphK1 and SphK2), and is abundantly present in different organs, including the brain. The medically important roles of receptor-mediated S1P signaling are well characterized in multiple sclerosis because FTY720 (Gilenya\u2122, Novartis), a non-selective S1P receptor modulator, is currently used as a treatment for this disease. In cerebral ischemia, its role is also notable because of FTY720's efficacy in both rodent models and human patients with cerebral ischemia. In particular, some of the S1P receptors, including S1P<sub>1</sub>, S1P<sub>2</sub>, and S1P<sub>3</sub>, have been identified as pathogenic players in cerebral ischemia. Other than these receptors, S1P itself and S1P-producing enzymes have been shown to play certain roles in cerebral ischemia. This review aims to compile the current updates and overviews about the roles of S1P signaling, along with a focus on S1P receptors in cerebral ischemia, based on recent studies that used in vivo rodent models of cerebral ischemia.", "150": "Although acute retinal necrosis (ARN) and optic neuritis following herpes encephalitis are known causes of acute visual impairment associated with herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, there have been no reports of parainfectious optic neuritis associated with genital HSV type 2 (HSV-2) infection. A young Japanese woman developed unilateral optic neuritis 7 days after the onset of genital HSV-2 infection. Ophthalmologic examination revealed no findings suggestive of ARN and both multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica were ruled out by the brain images and serum antibody testing. An oral steroid therapy improved her symptoms. Here, we describe the first case of parainfectious optic neuritis associated with genital HSV-2 infection.", "151": "Myelination of axons in the central nervous system (CNS) is a concerted effort between many cell types, resulting in significant cross-talk and communication among cells. Adhesion G protein-coupled receptor ADGRG1 (GPR56) is expressed in all major glial cells and regulates a wide variety of physiological processes by mediating cell-cell and cell-matrix communications. Previous literature has demonstrated the requirement of ADGRG1 in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) during developmental myelination. However, it is unknown if ADGRG1 is responsible for myelin formation in a cell-type-specific manner. To that end, here we profiled myelin status in response to deletion of Adgrg1 specifically in OPCs, microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. Interestingly, we find that knocking out Adgrg1 in OPCs significantly decreases OPC proliferation and reduced number of myelinated axons. However, deleting Adgrg1 in microglia, astrocytes, and neurons does not impact developmental myelination. These data support an autonomous functional role for Adgrg1 in OPCs related to myelination.", "152": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent and aggressive cancer usually arising on a background of chronic liver injury involving inflammatory and hepatic regenerative processes.

Cis-UCA has immunomodulatory properties linked with several cutaneous diseases such as skin cancer, atopic dermatitis, and urticaria and associates with systemic diseases including multiple sclerosis. The levels of UCA in the skin, brain, urine, and feces reflect some physiological processes and may be disease biomarkers. Both isomers of UCA have therapeutic potential for a range of disorders.", "154": "In relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), relapse severity and residual disability are difficult to predict. Nevertheless, this information is crucial both for guiding relapse treatment strategies and for informing patients.", "155": "Many autoimmune therapies focus on immune suppression to reduce symptom severity and halt disease progression; however, currently approved treatments lack specificity for the autoantigen and rely on more global immune suppression. Multivalent antigen arrays can disarm pathogenic autoimmune B cell populations that specifically recognize the antigen of interest via their B cell receptor (BCR). Disarmament may be achieved by BCR engagement, crosslinking, and sustained receptor occupancy as a result of multivalent, high avidity BCR binding. To engage and explore this mechanism, a tetramer display of the encephalogenic proteolipid peptide (PLP139-151), referred to as 4-arm PLP139-151, was synthesized by copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition chemistry. Subcutaneous administration of 4-arm PLP139-151 completely ameliorated symptoms of paralysis in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis known as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Competitive binding of 4-arm PLP139-151 to PLP139-151-specific IgG in mouse serum demonstrated the enhanced avidity associated with the multivalent array compared to free peptide. Furthermore, key PLP139-151-reactive B cells were depleted following 4-arm PLP139-151 treatment, resulting in significant reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Together, these data demonstrate the potential of 4-arm PLP139-151 to silence autoreactive B cell populations and limit downstream activation of effector cells.", "156": "Specific therapies targeting B lymphocytes in multiple sclerosis (MS) have demonstrated reductions in disease activity and disability progression. Several observational studies have also shown the effects of targeting B lymphocytes in other rare CNS inflammatory diseases, such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and autoimmune encephalitis (AE). However, some drugs targeting cytokine receptors involved in B-lymphocyte maturation and proliferation resulted in negative outcomes in MS. These apparently conflicting findings have stimulated research on the pathophysiologic mechanisms of B lymphocytes in CNS inflammatory diseases. It has been demonstrated that B-lymphocytes participate in the pathogenesis of these conditions as antigen-presenting cells, producing proinflammatory cytokines that induce Th1 and Th17 responses and producing antibodies. However, they are also able to produce anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-10, functioning as regulators of autoimmunity. Understanding these diverse effects is essential for the development of focused treatments. In this review, we discuss the possible mechanisms that underlie B lymphocyte involvement in MS, NMOSD, and AE, and the outcomes obtained by treatments targeting B lymphocytes.", "157": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between illness acceptance, life satisfaction, stress intensity, and their impact on the quality of life (QOL) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).", "158": "Sensor-based technological therapy devices may be good candidates for neuromotor rehabilitation of people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), especially for treating upper extremities function limitations.

Eliminating MAP-the etiopathological agent might be a better strategy to treat MAP-associated autoimmune diseases. In this case study, we conducted a systematic in silico analysis to identify the metabolic chokepoints of MAP's mimicry proteins and their interacting partners. The probable inhibitors of chokepoint proteins were identified using DrugBank. DrugBank molecules were stringently screened and molecular interactions were analyzed by molecular docking and 'off-target' binding. Thus, we identified 18 metabolic chokepoints of MAP mimicry proteins and 13 DrugBank molecules that could inhibit three chokepoint proteins viz. katG, rpoB and narH. On the basis of molecular interaction between drug and target proteins finally eight DrugBank molecules, viz. DB00609, DB00951, DB00615, DB01220, DB08638, DB08226, DB08266 and DB07349 were selected and are proposed for treatment of three MAP-associated autoimmune diseases namely, T1DM, CD and multiple sclerosis. Because these molecules are either approved by the Food and Drug Administration or these are experimental drugs that can be easily incorporated in clinical studies or tested in vitro. The proposed strategy may be used to repurpose drugs to treat autoimmune diseases induced by other pathogens.", "161": "Cortical lesions are a primary driver of disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, noninvasive detection of cortical lesions with in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains challenging. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the common marmoset is a relevant animal model of MS for investigating the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to brain damage. This study aimed to characterize cortical lesions in marmosets with EAE using ultrahigh-field (7\u00a0T) MRI and histological analysis. Tissue preparation was optimized to enable the acquisition of high-spatial resolution (50-\u03bcm isotropic) T2*-weighted images. A total of 14 animals were scanned in this study, and 70% of the diseased animals presented at least one cortical lesion on postmortem imaging. Cortical lesions identified on MRI were verified with myelin proteolipid protein immunostaining. An optimized T2*-weighted sequence was developed for in vivo imaging and shown to capture 65% of cortical lesions detected postmortem. Immunostaining confirmed extensive demyelination with preserved neuronal somata in several cortical areas of EAE animals. Overall, this study demonstrates the relevance and feasibility of the marmoset EAE model to study cortical lesions, among the most important yet least understood features of MS.", "162": "The complex system of BAFF (B-cell-activating factor of the TNF family) and APRIL (A proliferation-inducing ligand) has been studied in animal models of autoimmune diseases such as those resembling human systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogren's syndrome and multiple sclerosis (MS). Accumulating evidence suggests that BAFF and APRIL have a physiological role in B cell immunity regulation, however inappropriate production of these factors may represent a key event which disrupts immune tolerance which is associated with systemic autoimmune diseases. Areas covered: We provide an update on the latest studies of the BAFF/APRIL system in multiple sclerosis, as well as on related clinical trials. Expert Opinion: Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that increased BAFF levels may interfere directly and indirectly with B cell immunity; this can lead to breakdown of immune tolerance, the production of autoantibodies and continuous local intracerebral inflammation and brain tissue destruction. A more comprehensive understanding of the cell/molecular mechanism immune reactions specifically regulated by BAFF/APRIL in MS would better elucidate the specific cell phenotype targeted by actual anti-BAFF/APRIL therapies; this may enable the identification of either specific biomarkers of MS subgroups that would benefit of anti-BAFF/APRIL treatments or new targets of MS-specific anti-BAFF/APRIL therapies.", "163": "Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands (GFLs) are able to promote the survival of multiple neuronal populations in the body and, therefore, hold considerable promise for disease-modifying treatments of diseases and conditions caused by neurodegeneration. Available data reveal the potential of GFLs for the therapy of Parkinson's disease, neuropathic pain and diseases caused by retinal degeneration but, also, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and, possibly, Alzheimer's disease. Despite promising data collected in preclinical models, clinical translation of GFLs is yet to be conducted. The main reasons for the limited success of GFLs clinical development are the poor pharmacological characteristics of GFL proteins, such as the inability of GFLs to cross tissue barriers, poor diffusion in tissues, biphasic dose-response and activation of several receptors in the organism in different cell types, along with ethical limitations on patients' selection in clinical trials. The development of small molecules selectively targeting particular GFL receptors with improved pharmacokinetic properties can overcome many of the difficulties and limitations associated with the clinical use of GFL proteins.

However, convergent evidences have suggested that WM abnormalities are also important components of AD, at the same extent as axonal and neuronal loss is critically involved in MS pathophysiology since early clinical stages. These observations have motivated a more thorough investigation about the possible mechanisms that could link neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, focusing on amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2). Neuroimaging studies have found that patients with AD have widespread WM abnormalities already at the earliest disease stages and prior to the presence of A\u03b2 plaques. Moreover, a correlation between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b2 levels and WM lesion load was found. On the other hand, recent studies suggest a predictive role for CSF A\u03b2 levels in MS, possibly due in the first instance to the reduced capacity for remyelination, consequently to a higher risk of WM damage progression, and ultimately to neuronal loss. We undertook a review of the recent findings concerning the involvement of CSF A\u03b2 levels in the MS disease course and of the latest evidence of AD related WM abnormalities, with the aim to discuss the potential causes that may connect WM damage and amyloid pathology.", "165": "To evaluate the effect of intrathecally (IT) delivered rituximab as a therapeutic intervention for progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS) during a 3-year follow-up period.", "166": "The frontal cortex and temporal lobes together regulate complex learning and memory capabilities. Here, we collected resting-state functional and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data before and after male rhesus macaque monkeys received extensive training to learn novel visuospatial discriminations (reward-guided learning). We found functional connectivity changes in orbitofrontal, ventromedial prefrontal, inferotemporal, entorhinal, retrosplenial, and anterior cingulate cortices, the subicular complex and the dorsal, medial thalamus. These cortico-cortical and thalamocortical changes in functional connectivity were accompanied by related white matter structural alterations in the uncinate fasciculus, fornix, and ventral prefrontal tract - tracts that connect (sub)cortical networks and are implicated in learning and memory processes in monkeys and humans. After the well-trained monkeys received fornix transection, they were impaired in learning new visuospatial discriminations. In addition, the functional connectivity profile that was observed after the training was altered. These changes were accompanied by white matter changes in the ventral prefrontal tract although the integrity of the uncinate fasciculus remained unchanged. Our experiments highlight the importance of different communication relayed amongst cortico-cortical and thalamocortical circuitry for the ability to learn new visuospatial associations (learning-to-learn) and to make reward-guided decisions.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b>Frontal neural networks and the temporal lobes contribute to reward-guided learning in mammals. Here, we provide novel insight by showing that specific cortico-cortical and thalamocortical functional connectivity is altered after rhesus monkeys received extensive training to learn novel visuospatial discriminations. Contiguous white matter fiber pathways linking these gray matter structures, namely the uncinate fasciculus, fornix, and ventral prefrontal tract, showed structural changes after completing training in the visuospatial task. Additionally, different patterns of functional and structural connectivity are reported after removal of subcortical connections within the extended hippocampal system, via fornix transection. These results highlight the importance of both cortico-cortical and thalamocortical interactions in reward-guided learning in the normal brain and identify brain structures important for memory capabilities after injury.", "167": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system characterized by demyelination of neurons and neurodegeneration. Current MS therapies ameliorate inflammatory damage but are unable to address the degenerative aspects of the disease.", "168": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative inflammatory disease where an autoimmune response to components of the central nervous system leads to a loss of myelin and subsequent neurological deterioration. People with MS can develop primary or secondary progressive disease (PPMS, SPMS) and differentiation of the specific differences in the pathogenesis of these two courses, at the molecular level, is currently unclear. Recently, lipidomics studies using human biofluids, mainly plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, have highlighted a possible role for lipids in the initiation and progression of MS. However, there is a lack of lipidomics studies in MS on CNS tissues, such as normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), where local inflammation initially occurs. Herein, we developed an untargeted reverse phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography time of flight tandem mass spectrometry (RP-UPLC-TOF MS<sup>E</sup>)-based workflow, in combination with multivariate and univariate statistical analysis, to assess significant differences in lipid profiles in brain NAWM from post-mortem cases of PPMS, SPMS and controls. Groups of eight control, nine PPMS and seven SPMS NAWM samples were used. Correlation analysis of the identified lipids by RP-UPLC-TOF MS<sup>E</sup> was undertaken to remove those lipids that correlated with age, gender and post-mortem interval as confounding factors. We demonstrate that there is a significantly altered lipid profile of control cases compared with MS cases and that progressive disease, PPMS and SPMS, can be differentiated on the basis of the lipidome of NAWM with good sensitivity, specificity and prediction accuracy based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed that the most altered lipid pathways between PPMS and SPMS were glycerophospholipid metabolism, glycerophosphatidyl inositol (GPI) anchor synthesis and linoleic acid metabolism. Further understanding of the impact of these lipid alterations described herein associated with progression will provide an increased understanding of the mechanisms underpinning progression and highlight possible new therapeutic targets.", "169": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects young adults, causing a variety of symptoms (motor alterations, visual alterations, loss of sphincter control, gait alterations) that impair the patient's functional status.

The development of treatments may be accelerated if novel biomarkers are developed to overcome the limitations of traditional imaging outcomes revealed in early phase trials. In January 2019, the International Progressive MS Alliance convened a standing expert panel to consider potential tissue fluid biomarkers in MS in general and in progressive MS specifically. The panel focused their attention on neurofilament light chain (NfL) in serum or plasma, examining data from both relapsing and progressive MS. Here, we report the initial conclusions of the panel and its recommendations for further research. Serum NfL (sNfL) is a plausible marker of neurodegeneration that can be measured accurately, sensitively, and reproducibly, but standard procedures for sample processing and analysis should be established. Findings from relapsing and progressive cohorts concur and indicate that sNfL concentrations correlate with imaging and disability measures, predict the future course of the disease, and can predict response to treatment. Importantly, disease activity from active inflammation (i.e., new T2 and gadolinium-enhancing lesions) is a large contributor to sNfL, so teasing apart disease activity from the disease progression that drives insidious disability progression in progressive MS will be challenging. More data are required on the effects of age and comorbidities, as well as the relative contributions of inflammatory activity and other disease processes. The International Progressive MS Alliance is well positioned to advance these initiatives by connecting and supporting relevant stakeholders in progressive MS.", "171": "In this mini review, we discuss some of the atypical neurological manifestations of dengue virus and attempt to bring them to attention to highlight the neurotropic property of the dengue virus.", "172": "Multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, generally starts as the relapsing remitting form (RRMS), but often shifts into secondary progressive MS (SPMS). SPMS represents a more advanced stage of MS, characterized by accumulating disabilities and refractoriness to medications. The aim of this study was to clarify the microbial and functional differences in gut microbiomes of the different stages of MS. Here, we compared gut microbiomes of patients with RRMS, SPMS, and two closely related disorders with healthy controls (HCs) by 16S rRNA gene and whole metagenomic sequencing data from fecal samples and by fecal metabolites. Each patient group had a number of species having significant changes in abundance in comparison with HCs, including short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria reduced in MS. Changes in some species had close association with clinical severity of the patients. A marked reduction in butyrate and propionate biosynthesis and corresponding metabolic changes were confirmed in RRMS compared with HCs. Although bacterial composition analysis showed limited differences between the patient groups, metagenomic functional data disclosed an increase in microbial genes involved in DNA mismatch repair in SPMS as compared to RRMS. Together with an increased ratio of cysteine persulfide to cysteine in SPMS revealed by sulfur metabolomics, we postulate that excessive DNA oxidation could take place in the gut of SPMS. Thus, gut ecological and functional microenvironments were significantly altered in the different stages of MS. In particular, reduced SCFA biosynthesis in RRMS and elevated oxidative level in SPMS were characteristic.", "173": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most frequent demyelinating disease in young adults and despite significant advances in immunotherapy, disease progression still cannot be prevented. Promotion of remyelination, an endogenous repair mechanism resulting in the formation of new myelin sheaths around demyelinated axons, represents a promising new treatment approach. However, remyelination frequently fails in MS lesions, which can in part be attributed to impaired differentiation of oligodendroglial progenitor cells into mature, myelinating oligodendrocytes. The reasons for impaired oligodendroglial differentiation and defective remyelination in MS are currently unknown. To determine whether intrinsic oligodendroglial factors contribute to impaired remyelination in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), we compared induced pluripotent stem cell-derived oligodendrocytes (hiOL) from RRMS patients and controls, among them two monozygous twin pairs discordant for MS. We found that hiOL from RRMS patients and controls were virtually indistinguishable with respect to remyelination-associated functions and proteomic composition. However, while analyzing the effect of extrinsic factors we discovered that supernatants of activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) significantly inhibit oligodendroglial differentiation. In particular, we identified CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as mediators of impaired oligodendroglial differentiation; at least partly due to interferon-gamma secretion. Additionally, we observed that blocked oligodendroglial differentiation induced by PBMC supernatants could not be restored by application of oligodendroglial differentiation promoting drugs, whereas treatment of PBMCs with the immunomodulatory drug teriflunomide prior to supernatant collection partly rescued oligodendroglial differentiation. In summary, these data indicate that the oligodendroglial differentiation block is not due to intrinsic oligodendroglial factors but rather caused by the inflammatory environment in RRMS lesions which underlines the need for drug screening approaches taking the inflammatory environment into account. Combined, these findings may contribute to the development of new remyelination promoting strategies.", "174": "Mitoxantrone (MTX) is used to treat several types of cancers and to improve neurological disability in multiple sclerosis.

Herein, we aimed to study early and late mechanisms of MTX-induced cardiotoxicity using murine HL-1 cardiomyocytes. Cells were exposed to MTX (0.1, 1 or 10\u00a0\u00b5M) during short (2, 4, 6, or 12\u00a0h) or longer incubation periods (24 or 48\u00a0h). At earlier time points, (6 and 12\u00a0h) cytotoxicity was already observed for 1 and 10\u00a0\u00b5M MTX. Proteomic analysis of total protein extracts found 14 proteins with higher expression and 26 with lower expression in the cells exposed for 12\u00a0h to MTX (pH gradients 4-7 and 6-11). Of note, the expression of the regulatory protein 14-3-3 protein epsilon was increased by a factor of two and three, after exposure to 1 and 10\u00a0\u00b5M MTX, respectively. At earlier time-points, 10\u00a0\u00b5M MTX increased intracellular ATP levels, while decreasing media lactate levels. At later stages (24 and 48\u00a0h), MTX-induced cytotoxicity was concentration and time-dependent, according to the MTT reduction and lactate dehydrogenase leakage assays, while caspase-9, -8 and -3 activities increased at 24\u00a0h. Regarding cellular redox status, total glutathione increased in 1\u00a0\u00b5M MTX (24\u00a0h), and that increase was dependent on gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase activity. Meanwhile, for both 1 and 10\u00a0\u00b5M MTX, oxidized glutathione was significantly higher than control at 48\u00a0h. Moreover, MTX was able to significantly decrease proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity in a concentration and time-independent manner. In summary, MTX significantly altered proteomic, energetic and oxidative stress homeostasis in cardiomyocytes at clinically relevant concentrations and our data clearly demonstrate that MTX causes early cardiotoxicity that needs further study.", "175": "Several lines of evidence have implicated white matter (WM) deficits in schizophrenia, including microstructural alterations from diffusion tensor (DTI) brain imaging studies. It has been proposed that dysregulated inflammatory processes, including heightened activity of circulating lymphocytes, may contribute to WM pathology in this illness. Fingolimod is a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist that is approved for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). Fingolimod robustly decreases the number of circulating lymphocytes through sequestration of these cells in lymph tissue. In addition, this agent improved WM microstructure as shown by increases in DTI fractional anisotropy (FA). In this pilot study, we assessed the effects of fingolimod on WM microstructure, cognition and symptoms in an eight-week, double-blind trial. Forty subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were randomized 1:1 to fingolimod (0.5\u00a0mg/day) and placebo. Fingolimod caused significant reductions in circulating lymphocytes (p\u2009<\u2009.001). In addition, there was a statistically non-significant association (p\u2009=\u2009.089) between DTI-FA change in the WM skeleton and fingolimod. There were significant relationships between the degree of lymphocyte reductions and increases in FA in the corpus collosum (p\u2009=\u2009.004) and right superior longitudinal fasciculus ( p\u2009=\u2009.02), and a non-significant correlation with the WM skeleton. There were no significant fingolimod versus placebo interactions on cognitive or symptom measures. There were no serious adverse events related to fingolimod treatment. Future studies with larger samples and treatment durations are needed to further establish fingolimod's potential therapeutic effects in schizophrenia.", "176": "The interleukin 23 (IL-23) is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine in the development of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis, inflammatory bowel diseases, multiple sclerosis, or rheumatoid arthritis. The pathological consequences of excessive IL-23 signaling have been linked to its ability to promote the production of inflammatory mediators, such as IL-17, IL-22, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating (GM-CSF), or the tumor necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1) by target populations, mainly Th17 and IL-17-secreting TCR\u03b3\u03b4 cells (T\u03b3\u03b417). Due to their pivotal role in inflammatory diseases, IL-23 and its downstream effector molecules have emerged as attractive therapeutic targets, leading to the development of neutralizing antibodies against IL-23 and IL-17 that have shown efficacy in different inflammatory diseases. Despite the success of monoclonal antibodies, there are patients that show no response or partial response to these treatments. Thus, effective therapies for inflammatory diseases may require the combination of multiple immune-modulatory drugs to prevent disease progression and to improve quality of life. Alternative strategies aimed at inhibiting intracellular signaling cascades using small molecule inhibitors or interfering peptides have not been fully exploited in the context of IL-23-mediated diseases. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge about proximal signaling events triggered by IL-23 upon binding to its membrane receptor to bring to the spotlight new opportunities for therapeutic intervention in IL-23-mediated pathologies.", "177": "Some environmental factors are associated with an increased risk of multiple sclerosis (MS). Air pollution could be a main one. This study was conducted to investigate the association of particulate matter 2.5 (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) concentrations with MS prevalence in the province of Pavia, Italy. The overall MS prevalence in the province of Pavia is 169.4 per 100,000 inhabitants. Spatial ground-level PM<sub>2.5</sub> gridded data were analysed, by municipality, for the period 2010-2016. Municipalities were grouped by tertiles according to PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration. Ecological regression and Bayesian statistics were used to analyse the association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations, degree of urbanization, deprivation index and MS risk. MS risk was higher among persons living in areas with an average winter PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration above the European annual limit value (25\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>). The Bayesian map revealed sizeable MS high-risk clusters. The study found a relationship between low MS risk and lower PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels, strengthening the suggestion that air pollution may be one of the environmental risk factors for MS.", "178": "Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) has become increasingly popular in recent years as an effective treatment of immune mediated neurological diseases. Treatment related mortality has significantly reduced primarily through better patient selection, optimization of transplant technique and increased center experience. Area covered: Multiple sclerosis is the main indication, but people with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, stiff person spectrum disorder, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, myasthenia gravis and other immune-mediated neurological disorders also have been treated. The review herein discusses the use of AHSCT in these neurological disorders, the importance of patient selection and transplant technique optimization and future directions. Expert opinion: Phase II and III clinical trials have confirmed the safety and efficacy of AHSCT in multiple sclerosis and recent phase II clinical trials have also suggested its safety and efficacy in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, with the evidence in other neurological disorders limited to individual case reports, small case series and registry data. Therefore, further randomized controlled clinical trials are required to assess its safety and efficacy in other neurological conditions. However, in rare neurological conditions, pragmatic treatment trials or registry-based studies may be more realistic options for gathering efficacy and safety data.", "179": "The \u03b2-D-Mannuronic acid (M2000) as a novel immunosuppressive drug, patented (PCT/EP2017/067920), has shown positive effects in experimental model of multiple sclerosis (MS).

Here, we report that the cytokine IL-1\u03b2, which is abundantly produced during multiple sclerosis (MS), arthritis (RA), and osteoarthritis (OA) both in humans and in animal models, drives pain associated with these diseases. We found that the type 1 IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1) is highly expressed in the mouse and human by a subpopulation of TRPV1+ dorsal root ganglion neurons specialized in detecting painful stimuli, termed nociceptors. Strikingly, deletion of the Il1r1 gene specifically in TRPV1+ nociceptors prevented the development of mechanical allodynia without affecting clinical signs and disease progression in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and K/BxN serum transfer-induced RA. Conditional restoration of IL-1R1 expression in nociceptors of IL-1R1-knockout mice induced pain behavior but did not affect joint damage in monosodium iodoacetate-induced OA. Collectively, these data reveal that neuronal IL-1R1 signaling mediates pain, uncovering the potential benefit of anti-IL-1 therapies for pain management in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.", "181": "Pentraxin-3 (PTX-3) is involved in acute immunological responses and it is a pro-inflammatory protein and a novel biomarker of inflammatory diseases. It is demonstrated that PTX-3 is higher in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of aggressive Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Metabolomics, the identification of small endogenous molecules, offers a molecular profile of MS. Glatiramer acetate (GA) is a widely used treatment for (MS) but its mechanism of action is not completely defined. The aim of our study is to analyze PTX-3 and metabolomic profile in MS patients compared to controls and to investigate the effect of GA on PXT-3 and metabolic molecules during treatment in responder and not responder MS patients.", "182": "Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is the most commonly used and clinically relevant murine model for human multiple sclerosis (MS), a demyelinating autoimmune disease characterized by mononuclear cell infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS).

This study aimed to determine the association between demyelinating disease and the C1236T, G2677T/A, and C3435T variants of ABCB1 and its haplotypes and combinations of genotypes.", "184": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with burdensome memory impairments and preclinical literature suggests that these impairments are linked to neuroinflammation. Previously, we have shown that toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) antagonists, such as (+)-naltrexone [(+)-NTX], block neuropathic pain and associated spinal inflammation in rats. Here we extend these findings to first demonstrate that (+)-NTX blocks TLR2 in addition to TLR4. Additionally, we examined in two rat strains whether (+)-NTX could attenuate learning and memory disturbances and associated neuroinflammation using a low-dose experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS. EAE is the most commonly used experimental model for the human inflammatory demyelinating disease, MS. This low-dose model avoided motor impairments that would confound learning and memory measurements. Fourteen days later, daily subcutaneous (+)-NTX or saline injections began and continued throughout the study. Contextual and auditory-fear conditioning were conducted at day 21 to assess hippocampal and amygdalar function. With this low-dose model, EAE impaired long-term, but not short-term, contextual fear memory; both long-term and short-term auditory-cued fear memory were spared. This was associated with increased mRNA for hippocampal interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), TLR2, TLR4, NLRP3, and IL-17 and elevated expression of the microglial marker Iba1 in CA1 and DG regions of the hippocampus, confirming the neuroinflammation observed in higher-dose EAE models. Importantly, (+)-NTX completely prevented the EAE-induced memory impairments and robustly attenuated the associated proinflammatory effects. These findings suggest that (+)-NTX may exert therapeutic effects on memory function by dampening the neuroinflammatory response in the hippocampus through blockade of TLR2/TLR4. This study suggests that TLR2 and TLR4 antagonists may be effective at treating MS-related memory deficits.", "185": "Multiple sclerosis is a common autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system.

This study aims at proposing quantitative indices to measure the gait deterioration effects. The experimental protocol consisted in a 6-min walking test and it involved nine patients with MS and twenty-six healthy subjects. Pathology severity was assessed through the Expanded Disability Status Scale. Seven inertial units were used to gather lower limb kinematics. Gait variability and asymmetry were assessed by coefficient of variation (CoV) and symmetry index (SI), respectively. The evolution of ROM (range of motion), CoV, and SI was computed analyzing data divided into six 60-s subgroups. Maximum difference among subgroups and the difference between the first minute and the remaining five were computed. The indices were analyzed for intra- and inter-day reliability and repeatability. Correlation with clinical scores was also evaluated. Good to excellent reliability was found for all indices. The computed standard deviations allowed us to affirm the good repeatability of the indices. The outcomes suggested walking-related fatigue leads to an always more variable kinematics in MS, in terms of changes in ROM, increase of variability and asymmetry. The hip asymmetry strongly correlated with the clinical disability.", "187": "Gastric cancer (GC) is found as the second leading cause of cancer associated deaths in the world which is usually detected in the advanced stages. It has been showed that surgery is major therapeutic approach in the treatment subjects with GC. Hence, early and fast diagnosis of this malignancy is very important issue for good subject outcomes. Noninvasive diagnostic platforms including evolutionary endoscopy and positron emission tomography (PET) are employed as diagnosis for subjects with GC. Along to imaging techniques, utilization of biomarkers has been emerged as new diagnosis options in early and fast detection of GC. Multiple lines evidence revealed, a variety of biomarkers including microRNAs, exosomes, circulating tumor cells, circular RNAs, cell free DNAs, and various proteins could be used as diagnostic biomarkers in patients with GC. Taken together, these findings suggested that joint application of imaging techniques and different biomarkers, could be introduced as new detection approaches in the treatment and screening response to therapy in the subjects with GC. Herein, we summarized various imaging techniques and biomarkers as powerful tools in the detection of GC.", "188": "Plasma exchange (PE) and immunoadsorption (IA) are frequently used for treatment of various autoimmune-mediated neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS). Although both methods are generally regarded as well-tolerated treatment options, evidence for safety and tolerability is low for most indications and largely relies on small case series. In this study, we retrospectively analysed adverse events (AEs) and laboratory changes in 284 patients with various neurological indications who received either PE (<i>n</i> = 65, 113 cycles) or IA (<i>n</i> = 219, 435 cycles) between 2013 and 2020 in our Neurology department. One standard treatment cycle for PE as well as IA consisted of five treatments on five consecutive days. During every treatment, the 2.0-2.5-fold individual plasma volume (PV) was treated in IA, while in PE, the 0.7-fold individual PV was replaced by human albumin solution. Overall, both methods showed an excellent safety profile; no deaths of life-threatening adverse events were recorded. Severe AEs (corresponding to grade 3 on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grading scale v5.0) including three patients with sepsis, one pneumonia, and one pneumothorax were present in 5/435 IA cycles (1.1%); in the PE group, no severe AEs were recorded. Furthermore, although advantageous tolerability is generally considered the main advantage of IA over PE, we found that overall frequency of AEs (including grades 1 and 2) was higher in IA (67.1% of all cycles) compared to PE (35.4%; <i>p</i> < 0.001). The low incidence of AEs in PE might be caused by the lower PV exchanged during each treatment (0.7-fold) compared to previous studies which predominantly exchanged the 1.0-1.5-fold PV. In order to verify this hypothesis as well as confirming the efficacy of this lower-dosed scheme, prospective studies comparing different treatment regimens are needed.", "189": "To evaluate the performance of novel spiral MRSI and tissue segmentation pipeline of the brain, to investigate neurometabolic changes in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and white matter lesions (WML) of stable relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) compared to healthy controls (HCs).", "190": "The multi-compartment diffusion MRI using the spherical mean technique (SMT) has been suggested to enhance the pathological specificity to tissue injury in multiple sclerosis (MS) imaging, but its accuracy and precision have not been comprehensively evaluated.", "191": "Advanced neuroimaging techniques may offer the potential to monitor disease spreading in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We aim to investigate brain functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in a cohort of ALS patients, examined at diagnosis and clinically monitored over 18 months, in order to early discriminate fast progressors (FPs) from slow progressors (SPs). <i>Methods:</i> Resting state functional MRI (RS-fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analyses were performed at baseline in 54 patients with ALS and 22 HCs. ALS patients were classified <i>a posteriori</i> into FPs (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200925) and SPs (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200929) based on changes in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised score from baseline to the 18-month assessment (\u0394ALSFRS-R), applying a k-means clustering algorithm. <i>Results:</i> At diagnosis, when compared to HCs, ALS patients showed reduced functional connectivity in both motor and extra-motor networks. When compared to SPs, at baseline, FPs showed decreased function connectivity in paracentral lobule (sensorimotor network), precuneus (in the default mode network), middle frontal gyri (frontoparietal networks) and increased functional connectivity in insular cortices (salience network). Structural analyses did not reveal significant differences in gray and white matter damage by comparing FPs to SPs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that functional connectivity increase in the left insula at baseline best discriminated FPs and SPs (area under the curve 78%). <i>Conclusions:</i> Impairment of extra-motor networks may appear early in ALS patients with faster disease progression, suggesting that a more widespread functional connectivity damage may be an indicator of poorer prognosis.", "192": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) which is associated with lower life expectancy and disability. The experimental antigen-induced encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice is a useful animal model of MS, which allows exploring the etiopathogenetic mechanisms and testing novel potential therapeutic drugs. A new therapeutic paradigm for the treatment of MS was introduced in 2010 through the sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) analogue fingolimod (FTY720, Gilenya<sup>\u00ae</sup>), which acts as a functional S1P<sub>1</sub> antagonist on T lymphocytes to deplete these cells from the blood. In this study, we synthesized two novel structures, ST-1893 and ST-1894, which are derived from fingolimod and chemically feature a morpholine ring in the polar head group. These compounds showed a selective S1P<sub>1</sub> activation profile and a sustained S1P<sub>1</sub> internalization in cultures of S1P<sub>1</sub>-overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells, consistent with a functional antagonism. In vivo, both compounds induced a profound lymphopenia in mice. Finally, these substances showed efficacy in the EAE model, where they reduced clinical symptoms of the disease, and, on the molecular level, they reduced the T-cell infiltration and several inflammatory mediators in the brain and spinal cord. In summary, these data suggest that S1P<sub>1</sub>-selective compounds may have an advantage over fingolimod and siponimod, not only in MS but also in other autoimmune diseases.", "193": "Cannabis is an annual plant with a long history of use as food, feed, fiber, oil, medicine, and narcotics. Despite realizing its true value, it has not yet found its true place. Cannabis has had a long history with many ups and downs, and now it is our turn to promote it. Cannabis contains approximately 600 identified and many yet unidentified potentially useful compounds. Cannabinoids, phenolic compounds, terpenoids, and alkaloids are some of the secondary metabolites present in cannabis. However, among a plethora of unique chemical compounds found in this plant, the most important ones are phytocannabinoids (PCs). Over hundreds of 21-22-carbon compounds exclusively produce in cannabis glandular hairs through either polyketide and or deoxyxylulose phosphate/methylerythritol phosphate (DOXP/MEP) pathways. Trans-\u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03949-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are those that first come to mind while talking about cannabis. Nevertheless, despite the low concentration, cannabinol (CBN), cannabigerol (CBG), cannabichromene (CBC), tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), cannabidivarin (CBDV), cannabinodiol (CBND), and cannabinidiol (CBDL) may have potentially some medical effects. PCs and endocannabinoids (ECs) mediate their effects mainly through CB1 and CB2 receptors. Despite all concerns regarding cannabis, nobody can ignore the use of cannabinoids as promising tonic, analgesic, antipyretic, antiemetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-epileptic, anticancer agents, which are effective for pain relief, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, nausea and vomiting, multiple sclerosis, cardiovascular disorders, and appetite stimulation. The scientific community and public society have now increasingly accepted cannabis specifically hemp as much more than a recreational drug. There are growing demands for cannabinoids, mainly CBD, with many diverse therapeutic and nutritional properties in veterinary or human medicine.

Alterations of monoamine signalling were reported in multiple sclerosis (MS) and psychiatric illness and may account for the high prevalence of comorbid depression and fatigue in MS patients. We assessed central noradrenaline transporter (NAT) availability using positron emission tomography (PET) and the NAT selective radiotracer S,S-[<sup>11</sup>C]O-methylreboxetine in immunotherapy-na\u00efve patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS; n\u2009=\u200911) compared to healthy controls (HC; n\u2009=\u200912), and its association to lesion load, time since manifestation, the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), the fatigue scale W\u00fcrzburger Ersch\u00f6pfungsinventar bei MS (WEIMuS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). We found NAT availability to be increased in the thalamus, amygdala, putamen and pons/midbrain of MS patients. No relation to clinical or psychometric variables was found. These first data indicate higher NAT availability in subcortical brain regions of immunotherapy-na\u00efve RRMS patients. If these changes of noradrenergic neurotransmission predispose to psychiatric symptoms or associate with disease activity needs to be investigated in longitudinal studies or a larger sample which allows subgroup analyses.", "195": "Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) has emerged as a first-line treatment for the relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) subtype. It is hypothesized that DMF has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects although mechanisms are not fully understood. This study used RNA-seq to profile gene expression responses to DMF in cultured astrocytes. Responses were compared with those of isosorbide di-(methyl fumarate) (IDMF), a newly designed fumarate that may partially replicate DMF activity with fewer adverse effects. Both compounds altered the expression of MS-associated genes, including those near MS susceptibility loci and genes dysregulated in MS patient astrocytes. The shared DMF/IDMF transcriptome response involved altered expression of antioxidant genes (e.g., HMOX1) and genes linked to extracellular matrix integrity (TIMP3, MMP9) and migration of pro-inflammatory cells into CNS (CCL2). IDMF-specific transcriptome responses included down-regulation of mitotic genes associated with a proliferative reactive astrocyte phenotype (ICAM1) and repression of genes encoding NF-kappaB subunits (NFKB2, RELA, RELB) and NF-kappaB targets (NCAPG, CXCL1, OAS3). Overall, these results identify astrocyte-centered mechanisms that may contribute to the established efficacy of DMF as an RRMS treatment. Furthermore, our findings support a rationale for further studies of IDMF as a novel fumarate, which may have unique suppressive effects on astrocyte reactivity and glial scar formation.

In effort to develop effective anti-neuroinflammatory compounds, different new linear polyoxygenated diarylheptanoids were synthesized. In LPS-triggered BV-2 microglial cells their ability to reduce the concentration of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 pro-inflammatory cytokines was evaluated. Moreover, their effect on NF-\u03baB and ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), a recently emerged target of metabolic reprogramming in inflammation, was assessed. Finally, we turned our attention to inflammatory mediators derived from the cleavage of citrate catalyzed by ACLY: prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>, nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species. All compounds showed null or minimal cytotoxicity; most of them had a great anti-neuroinflammatory activity. Diarylheptanoids 6b and 6c, bearing a halide atom and benzyl ether protective groups, exhibited the best effect since they blocked the secretion of all inflammatory mediators analyzed and reduced NF-\u03baB and ACLY protein levels.", "197": "Each neurodegenerative syndrome reflects a stereotyped pattern of cellular, regional, and large-scale brain network degeneration. In behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), a disorder of social-emotional function, von Economo neurons (VENs), and fork cells are among the initial neuronal targets. These large layer 5 projection neurons are concentrated in the anterior cingulate and frontoinsular (FI) cortices, regions that anchor the salience network, a large-scale system linked to social-emotional function. Here, we studied patients with bvFTD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or both, given that these syndromes share common pathobiological and genetic factors. Our goal was to determine how neuron type-specific TAR DNA-binding protein of 43\u00a0kDa (TDP-43) pathobiology relates to atrophy in specific brain structures and to loss of emotional empathy, a cardinal feature of bvFTD. We combined questionnaire-based empathy assessments, in vivo structural MR imaging, and quantitative histopathological data from 16 patients across the bvFTD/ALS spectrum. We show that TDP-43 pathobiology within right FI VENs and fork cells is associated with salience network atrophy spanning insular, medial frontal, and thalamic regions. Gray matter degeneration within these structures mediated loss of emotional empathy, suggesting a chain of influence linking the cellular, regional/network, and behavioral levels in producing signature bvFTD clinical features.", "198": "Inflammatory demyelination and axonal injury in the central nervous system (CNS) are cardinal features of progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), and linked to activated brain macrophage-like cells (BMCs) including resident microglia and trafficking macrophages. Caspase-1 is a pivotal mediator of inflammation and cell death in the CNS. We investigated the effects of caspase-1 activation and its regulation in models of MS. Brains from progressive MS and non-MS patients, as well as cultured human oligodendrocytes were examined by transcriptomic and morphological methods. Next generation transcriptional sequencing of progressive MS compared to non-MS patients' normal appearing white matter (NAWM) showed induction of caspase-1 as well as other inflammasome-associated genes with concurrent suppression of neuron-specific genes. Oligodendrocytes exposed to TNF\u03b1 exhibited upregulation of caspase-1 with myelin gene suppression in a cell differentiation state-dependent manner. Brains from cuprizone-exposed mice treated by intranasal delivery of the caspase-1 inhibitor, VX-765 or its vehicle, were investigated in morphological and molecular studies, as well as by fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging. Cuprizone exposure resulted in BMC and caspase-1 activation accompanied by demyelination and axonal injury, which was abrogated by intranasal VX-765 treatment. FDG-PET imaging revealed suppressed glucose metabolism in the thalamus, hippocampus and cortex of cuprizone-exposed mice that was restored with VX-765 treatment. These studies highlight the caspase-1 dependent interactions between inflammation, demyelination, and glucose metabolism in progressive MS and associated models. Intranasal delivery of an anti-caspase-1 therapy represents a promising therapeutic approach for progressive MS and other neuro-inflammatory diseases.", "199": "Neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by the recruitment of circulating blood-borne innate and adaptive immune cells into the central nervous system (CNS). These leukocytes sustain the detrimental response in the CNS by releasing pro-inflammatory mediators that induce activation of local glial cells, blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and neural cell death. However, infiltrating peripheral immune cells could also dampen CNS inflammation and support tissue repair. Recent advances in the field of immunometabolism demonstrate the importance of metabolic reprogramming for the activation and functionality of such innate and adaptive immune cell populations. In particular, an increasing body of evidence suggests that the activity of metabolites and metabolic enzymes could influence the pathogenic potential of immune cells during neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders.

Microglial toxicity was suggested to mediate depression and plays key roles in neuroinflammatory and degenerative diseases, where there is critical shortage in therapies. We examined the effects of electroconvulsive seizures (ECS) on chronic neuroinflammation and microglial neurotoxicity. Electric brain stimulation inducing full tonic-clonic seizures during chronic relapsing-progressive experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) reduced spinal immune cell infiltration, reduced myelin and axonal loss, and prevented clinical deterioration. Using the transfer EAE model, we examined the effect of ECS on systemic immune response in donor mice versus ECS effect on CNS innate immune activity in recipient mice. ECS did not affect encephalitogenicity of systemic T cells, but it targeted the CNS directly to inhibit T cell-induced neuroinflammation. In vivo and ex vivo assays indicated that ECS suppressed microglial neurotoxicity by reducing inducible NOS expression, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and by reducing CNS oxidative stress. Microglia from ECS-treated EAE mice expressed less T cell stimulatory and chemoattractant factors. Our findings indicate that electroconvulsive therapy targets the CNS innate immune system to reduce neuroinflammation by attenuating microglial neurotoxicity. These findings signify a potentially novel therapeutic approach for chronic neuroinflammatory, neuropsychiatric, and neurodegenerative diseases.", "204": "No studies have assessed changes in employment survival in multiple sclerosis (MS) populations over recent decades, including the introduction of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs).", "205": "Pain is an important and frequent symptom in multiple sclerosis (MS), which leads to a low quality of life, increased disability level, and lack of employment and mental health.

Only HIIT reduced the NLR over the 3-week intervention period. These training effects might be due to repetitive inflammatory states with compensatory anti-inflammatory counterbalancing after each HIIT session.", "208": "Rates of unemployment among individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) are as high as 80%.", "209": "Olfactory dysfunction has been linked to clinical severity variables in multiple MS populations.

Long-term exposure to an anoxic environment can lead to neuropsychiatric symptoms and increases the likelihood of depression. Demyelination is an important lesion of CNS injury that may occur in depression. Previous studies have found that the RhoA/ROCK pathway is upregulated in neuropsychiatric disorders such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the chief aim of this study is to explore the regulatory role of the RhoA/ROCK pathway in the development of depression after hypoxia by behavioral tests, Western blotting, immunostaining as well as electron microscopy. Results showed that HIF-1\u03b1, S100\u03b2, RhoA/ROCK, and immobility time in FST were increased, sucrose water preference ratio in SPT was decreased, and the aberrant activity of neurocyte and demyelination occurred after hypoxia. After the administration of Y-27632 and fluoxetine in hypoxia, these alterations were improved. Lingo1, a negative regulatory factor, was also overexpressed after hypoxia and its expression was decreased when the pathway blocked. However, fluoxetine had no effect on the expression of Lingo1. Then, we demonstrated that demyelination was associated with failures of oligodendrocyte precursor cell proliferation and differentiation and increased apoptosis of oligodendrocytes. Collectively, our data indicate that the RhoA/ROCK pathway plays a vital role in the initial depression during hypoxia. Blocking this pathway in the early stage of hypoxia can enhance the effectiveness of antidepressants, rescue myelin damage, and reduce the expression of the negative regulatory protein of myelination. The findings provide new insight into the prophylaxis and treatment of depression.", "216": "A repeat expansion in C9orf72 is responsible for the characteristic neurodegeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) in a still unresolved manner. Proposed mechanisms involve gain-of-functions, comprising RNA and protein toxicity, and loss-of-function of the C9orf72 gene. Their exact contribution is still inconclusive and reports regarding loss-of-function are rather inconsistent. Here, we review the function of the C9orf72 protein and its relevance in disease. We explore the potential link between reduced C9orf72 levels and disease phenotypes in postmortem, in vitro, and in vivo models. Moreover, the significance of loss-of-function in other non-coding repeat expansion diseases is used to clarify its contribution in C9orf72 ALS/FTD. In conclusion, with evidence pointing to a multiple-hit model, loss-of-function on itself seems to be insufficient to cause neurodegeneration in C9orf72 ALS/FTD.", "217": "Susac syndrome (SuS) is a rare condition characterized by a clinical triad of sensorineural hearing loss, branch artery occlusion and encephalopathy.

To address these questions, a study using a unique post-mortem cohort wherein whole body autopsy reports and brain tissue were available for interrogation was established. Whole body autopsy reports were used to develop a global score of systemic vascular disease that included aorta and coronary artery atheroma, cardiac hypertensive disease, myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke. The score was applied to 85 multiple sclerosis cases (46 females, age range 39 to 84 years, median 62.0 years) and 68 control cases. Post-mortem brain material from a subset of the multiple sclerosis (n\u2009=\u200942; age range 39-84 years, median 61.5 years) and control (n\u2009=\u200939) cases was selected for detailed neuropathological study. For each case, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from the frontal and occipital white matter, basal ganglia and pons was used to obtain a global cerebral small vessel disease score that captured the presence and/or severity of arteriolosclerosis, periarteriolar space dilatation, haemosiderin leakage, microinfarcts, and microbleeds. The extent of multiple sclerosis-related pathology (focal demyelination and inflammation) was characterized in the multiple sclerosis cases. Regression models were used to investigate the influence of disease status on systemic vascular disease and cerebral small vessel disease scores and, in the multiple sclerosis group, the relationship between multiple sclerosis-related pathology and both vascular scores. We show that: (i) systemic cardiovascular burden, and specifically atherosclerosis, is lower and cerebral small vessel disease is higher in multiple sclerosis cases that die at younger ages compared with control subjects; (ii) the association between systemic vascular disease and cerebral small vessel disease is stronger in patients with multiple sclerosis compared with control subjects; and (iii) periarteriolar changes, including periarteriolar space dilatation, haemosiderin deposition and inflammation, are key features of multiple sclerosis pathology outside the classic demyelinating lesion. Our data argue against a common primary trigger for atherosclerosis and multiple sclerosis but suggest that an excess burden of cerebral small vessel disease in multiple sclerosis may explain the link between vascular comorbidity and accelerated irreversibility disability.", "219": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by non-cancerous tumors in multiple organs including the brain, kidney, lung, heart, and skin. We encountered a Japanese family consisting of two siblings (a four-year-old boy and a one-year-old girl) with multiple cardiac rhabdomyomas conveying a high risk of TSC and apparently unaffected sibling (a two-year-old girl) and parents. Whole exome sequencing and application of Integrative Genomic Viewer revealed an identical intragenic TSC1 deletion with the breakpoints on intron 15 and exon 19 in the affected siblings, but not in the apparently unaffected sibling and parents. Subsequently, PCR-based analyses were performed using primers flanking the deletion, showing that the deletion was also present in the father and that the deletion occurred between chr9:135,777,038 (bp) and chr9:135,780,540 (bp) in association with a one bp overlap. Furthermore, RT-PCR analyses were carried out using lymphoblastoid cell lines, revealing a major in-frame insertion/deletion transcript produced by aberrant splicing using a cryptic \u2033ag\u2033 splice acceptor motif at intron 15 (r.1998_2438delinsTTCATTAGGTGG) and a minor frameshift transcript generated by aberrant splicing between exon 15 and exon 20 (r.1998_2502del, p.Lys666Asnfs*15) in the affected siblings. These findings imply that the intragenic deletion producing two aberrant transcripts was generated as a somatic pathogenic variant involving the germline in the father and was transmitted to the affected siblings.", "220": "In recent years, studying the role of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in many pathological inflammatory conditions has become a very active research area.

Our objectives in this review are to address some recent advances in MDSC research in order to minimize such confusion and to provide an insight into their function in the context of other diseases. The following topics will be specifically focused upon: (1) definition and characterization of MDSCs; (2) whether all MDSC populations consist of immature cells; (3) technical issues in MDSC isolation, estimation and characterization; (4) the origin of MDSCs and their anatomical distribution in health and disease; (5) mediators of MDSC expansion and accumulation; (6) factors that determine the expansion of one MDSC population over the other; (7) the Yin and Yang roles of MDSCs.

MS can, for example, cause pain, changes in mood and fatigue, and may impair a person's movement, speech and visual functions. Diagnosis of MS typically involves a combination of complex clinical assessments and tests to rule out other diseases with similar symptoms. New technologies, such as smartphone monitoring in free-living conditions, could potentially aid in objectively assessing the symptoms of MS by quantifying symptom presence and intensity over long periods of time. Here, we present a deep-learning approach to diagnosing MS from smartphone-derived digital biomarkers that uses a novel combination of a multilayer perceptron with neural soft attention to improve learning of patterns in long-term smartphone monitoring data. Using data from a cohort of 774 participants, we demonstrate that our deep-learning models are able to distinguish between people with and without MS with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.88). Our experimental results indicate that digital biomarkers derived from smartphone data could in the future be used as additional diagnostic criteria for MS.", "222": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic progressive neurological disorder.

A randomized, controlled intervention study was carried out. In total, 31 subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (14 men and 17 women) were stratified and randomized into an intervention group (17 subjects) and a control group (14 subjects). The intervention group completed three weekly training sessions for 24 weeks, while the control group pursued their normal daily activities. In this program, cognitive-motor tasks were completed at once (dual tasking). A 3D photogrammetry connected to a selective attention system designed for dual tasking while walking was used. Ground reaction forces were measured using two force plates, one for sit-to-stand testing, while the other was used for static force measurement. Postural equilibrium was examined using a stabilometric plate based for Romberg test assessment. The 24-week training program for multiple sclerosis patients improved their static peak force by 11% (<i>p</i> < 0\u2009.05), their rate of force development by 36% (<i>p</i> < 0.05), and their balance (<i>p</i> < 0.05).

While the cause of MS is unclear, the underlying pathomechanisms are thought to be either destruction by autoimmune T cells or dysfunction of myelin-producing cells. Recent advances have indicated that inflammasomes contribute the etiology of MS. Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes of the innate immune response involved in the processing of caspase-1, the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-18 as well as the cell death-mediated mechanism of pyroptosis and the activation of the adaptive immune response. Here we review the literature to date on the role of different inflammasome signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of MS and how these pathways may be targeted to reduce deleterious inflammatory processes and improve outcomes in this patient population.", "226": "Little is known about the relative contribution of comorbidities in predicting the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of people with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS).", "227": "More research is needed to understand the contribution of comorbidities to MS symptomatology.", "228": "It is unclear whether motor fatigability and perceived fatigue share a common pathophysiology in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). This cross-sectional investigation explored the relationship between the mechanisms of motor fatigability from cycling and fatigue severity in PwMS. Thirteen highly fatigued (HF) and thirteen non-fatigued (LF) PwMS, and thirteen healthy controls (CON) completed a step-test until volitional exhaustion on an innovative cycle ergometer. Neuromuscular evaluations involving femoral nerve electrical stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation were performed every three minutes throughout cycling. One-way ANOVA at baseline and exhaustion uncovered evidence of consistently smaller motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes (P = .011) and prolonged MEP latencies (P = .041) in HF, as well as a greater decline in maximal voluntary contraction force (HF: 63 \u00b1 13%; LF: 75 \u00b1 13%; CON: 73 \u00b1 11% of pre; P = .037), and potentiated twitch force (HF: 35 \u00b1 13%; LF: 50 \u00b1 16%; CON: 47 \u00b1 17% of pre; P = .049) in HF at volitional exhaustion. Hierarchical regression determined that fatigue severity on the Fatigue Severity Scale was predicted by prolonged MEP latencies (change in R<sup>2</sup> = .389), elevated peripheral muscle fatigability (change in R<sup>2</sup> = .183), and depressive symptoms (change in R<sup>2</sup> = .213). These findings indicate that MS-related fatigue is distinguished by disrupted corticospinal responsiveness which could suggest progressive pathology, but fatigability from whole-body exercise and depressive symptoms also influence perceptions of fatigue in PwMS.", "229": "There is a clinical interest in identifying normal appearing white matter (NAWM) areas in brain T2-weighted (T<sub>2</sub>W) MRI scans in multiple sclerosis (MS) subjects.

It is predominately nuclear and most of its functions are related to RNA and DNA metabolism. Excessive persistence of FUS within cytoplasmic phase-separated assemblies is implicated in the diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Phosphorylation of FUS's prion-like domain (PrLD), by nuclear PIKK-family kinases following DNA damage, was previously shown to alter FUS's liquid-phase and solid-phase transitions in cell models and in vitro. However, proteomic data suggest FUS's PrLD is phosphorylated at numerous additional sites and it is unknown if other non-PIKK and non-nuclear kinases might be influencing FUS's phase transitions. Here we evaluated disease mutations and stress conditions that increase FUS accumulation into cytoplasmic phase-separated structures. We observed that cytoplasmic liquid-phase structures contain FUS phosphorylated at novel sites, which occured independently of PIKK-family kinases. We engineered phosphomimetic substitutions within FUS's PrLD and observed that mimicking a few phosphorylation sites strongly inhibited FUS solid-phase aggregation, while minimally altering liquid-phase condensation. These effects occured independent of the exact location of the phosphomimetic substitutions, suggesting that modulation of PrLD phosphorylation may offer therapeutic strategies that are specific for solid-phase aggregation observed in disease.", "231": "Establishing differential diagnosis between different inflammatory causes of acute transverse myelitis (ATM) can be difficult.

The demyelination process can be repaired by the generation of a new sheath of myelin around the axon, a process termed remyelination. In MS patients, the demyelination-remyelination cycles are highly dynamic. Over the years, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been increasingly used in the diagnosis of MS and it is currently the most useful paraclinical tool to assess this diagnosis. However, conventional MRI pulse sequences are not specific for pathological mechanisms such as demyelination and remyelination. Recently, positron emission tomography (PET) with radiotracer [<sup>11</sup>C]PIB has become a promising tool to measure in-vivo myelin content changes which is essential to push forward our understanding of mechanisms involved in the pathology of MS, and to monitor individual patients in the context of clinical trials focused on repair therapies. However, PET imaging is invasive due to the injection of a radioactive tracer. Moreover, it is an expensive imaging test and not offered in the majority of medical centers in the world. In this work, by using multisequence MRI, we thus propose a method to predict the parametric map of [<sup>11</sup>C]PIB PET, from which we derived the myelin content changes in a longitudinal analysis of patients with MS. The method is based on the proposed conditional flexible self-attention GAN (CF-SAGAN) which is specifically adjusted for high-dimensional medical images and able to capture the relationships between the spatially separated lesional regions during the image synthesis process. Jointly applying the sketch-refinement process and the proposed attention regularization that focuses on the MS lesions, our approach is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Specifically, our method demonstrated a superior performance for the prediction of myelin content at voxel-wise level. More important, our method for the prediction of myelin content changes in patients with MS shows similar clinical correlations to the PET-derived gold standard indicating the potential for clinical management of patients with MS.", "234": "CCL-11 (eotaxin) is a chemokine with an important role in allergic conditions.

Mutant forms of ataxin-1 containing expanded glutamine stretches cause the movement disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) through a toxic gain-of-function mechanism in the cerebellum. Conversely, ATXN1 loss-of-function is implicated in cancer development and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. <i>ATXN1</i> was recently nominated as a susceptibility locus for multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we show that <i>Atxn1</i>-null mice develop a more severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) course compared to wildtype mice. The aggravated phenotype is mediated by increased T helper type 1 (Th1) cell polarization, which in turn results from the dysregulation of B cell activity. Ataxin-1 ablation in B cells leads to aberrant expression of key costimulatory molecules involved in proinflammatory T cell differentiation, including cluster of differentiation (CD)44 and CD80. In addition, comprehensive phosphoflow cytometry and transcriptional profiling link the exaggerated proliferation of ataxin-1 deficient B cells to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways. Lastly, selective deletion of the physiological binding partner capicua (CIC) demonstrates the importance of ATXN1 native interactions for correct B cell functioning. Altogether, we report a immunomodulatory role for ataxin-1 and provide a functional description of the <i>ATXN1</i> locus genetic association with MS risk.", "237": "Hypertension-induced renal injury is a multifactorial process which plays a crucial role in the development of chronic kidney disease. Multiple studies have demonstrated that interstitial rather than glomerular changes correlate better with renal functional capacity. Recent evidence indicates that mast cells and cell signaling proteins such as fibroblast growth factor-2 may contribute to the progression of interstitial changes under hypertensive conditions. The aim of our study was to determine the localization of mast cells in the renal cortex and report on the changes in their number, to analyze the distribution of fibroblast growth factor-2, to assess the extent of renal fibrosis and to evaluate renal damage and correlate it with the changes in the number of mast cells in a model of hypertension-induced renal injury by comparing two age groups of spontaneously hypertensive rats. We used 6- and 12-month-old animals. A light microscopic study was conducted on sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff stain, Mallory's trichrome method and toluidine blue. For the immunohistochemical study we used monoclonal antibodies against mast cell tryptase and fibroblast growth factor-2 and a polyclonal antibody against c-kit. The expression of fibroblast growth factor-2 was assessed semi-quantitatively. The number of mast cells was evaluated on toluidine blue-, tryptase- and c-kit-stained sections, as well as double-stained sections and a comparative statistical analysis with the Mann-Whitney test was conducted between the two age groups. Our results showed that mast cells were located mainly in the peritubular and perivascular areas and were absent in the region of the renal corpuscles. Their number increased significantly in 12-month-old animals. Immunostaining for tryptase, c-kit and double staining for both molecules yielded identical results. The immunohistochemical expression of fibroblast growth factor-2 increased in the kidneys of older animals, as did the percentage of collagen fibers. In addition, we described more severe renal damage in 12-month-old spontaneously hypertensive rats and noted a positive correlation in both age groups between the number of mast cells on the one hand and glomerular sclerosis index and tubulointerstitial damage index, on the other. The results obtained in the present study support the pivotal role of mast cells in the development of hypertension-induced kidney damage.", "238": "Multiple sclerosis typically affects young women of reproductive age.

The objective of this study was to review previous studies of Finnish MS epidemiology, introduce new data on MS prevalence in western parts of Finland and do further analyses on data from previous studies. We performed a systematic search on articles regarding MS epidemiology in Finland in PubMed database, and all relevant articles were included in this review. MS prevalences in the western hospital districts of Vaasa, South Ostrobothnia and Pirkanmaa were calculated in 1980-2007 by using previously unpublished data obtained from a retrospective search from hospital administrative registries. To enhance comparability of the epidemiological figures, we calculated age-standardized prevalence of MS from the new data from western hospital districts and previous data from North Ostrobothnia, Southwest Finland and North Karelia. Marked regional differences in MS epidemiology were confirmed with concentration of the disease in the western and south-western parts of the country. The highest regional age-standardized MS prevalence of 288/100\u00a0000 was reported in South Ostrobothnia in 2007. A clear and stable increase in MS prevalence was observed through the decades, but the only marked increase in incidence happened in 1990s. Methodological differences hampered direct comparisons of different studies, highlighting the importance of common principles of reporting and standardizing the epidemiological figures.

Despite significant advances in immunotherapies in recent years, disease progression still cannot be prevented. Remyelination, meaning the formation of new myelin sheaths after a demyelinating event, can fail in MS lesions. Impaired differentiation of progenitor cells into myelinating oligodendrocytes may contribute to remyelination failure and, therefore, the development of pharmacological approaches which promote oligodendroglial differentiation and by that remyelination, represents a promising new treatment approach. However, this generally accepted concept has been challenged recently. To further understand mechanisms contributing to remyelination failure in MS, we combined detailed histological analyses assessing oligodendroglial cell numbers, presence of remyelination as well as the inflammatory environment in different MS lesion types in white matter with in vitro experiments using induced-pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived oligodendrocytes (hiOL) and supernatants from polarized human microglia. Our findings suggest that there are multiple reasons for remyelination failure in MS which are dependent on lesion stage. These include lack of myelin sheath formation despite the presence of mature oligodendrocytes in a subset of active lesions as well as oligodendroglial loss and a hostile tissue environment in mixed active/inactive lesions. Therefore, we conclude that better in vivo and in vitro models which mimic the pathological hallmarks of the different MS lesion types are required for the successful development of remyelination promoting drugs.", "242": "MicroRNAs are recognized as important regulators of many facets of physiological brain function while also being implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurological disorders. Dysregulation of miR155 is widely reported across a variety of neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and traumatic brain injury. In previous work, we observed that experimentally validated miR155 gene targets were consistently enriched among genes identified as differentially expressed across multiple brain tissue and disease contexts. In particular, we found that human herpesvirus-6A (HHV-6A) suppressed miR155, recapitulating reports of miR155 inhibition by HHV-6A in infected T-cells, thyrocytes, and natural killer cells. In earlier studies, we also reported the effects of constitutive deletion of miR155 on accelerating the accumulation of A\u03b2 deposits in 4-month-old APP/PSEN1 mice. Herein, we complete the cumulative characterization of transcriptomic, electrophysiological, neuropathological, and learning behavior profiles from 4-, 8- and 10-month-old WT and APP/PSEN1 mice in the absence or presence of miR155. We also integrated human post-mortem brain RNA-sequences from four independent AD consortium studies, together comprising 928 samples collected from six brain regions. We report that gene expression perturbations associated with miR155 deletion in mouse cortex are in aggregate observed to be concordant with AD-associated changes across these independent human late-onset AD (LOAD) data sets, supporting the relevance of our findings to human disease. LOAD has recently been formulated as the clinicopathological manifestation of a\u00a0multiplex of genetic underpinnings and pathophysiological mechanisms. Our accumulated data are consistent with such a formulation, indicating that miR155 may be uniquely positioned at the intersection of at least four components of this LOAD \"multiplex\": (1) innate immune response pathways; (2) viral response gene networks; (3) synaptic pathology; and (4) proamyloidogenic pathways involving the amyloid \u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2).", "243": "To develop a simulation model assessing the efficiency of using cladribine tablets versus infusion-based disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) from a facility perspective in the UK.", "244": "Slowly expanding/evolving lesions measured by conventional T1-weighted/T2-weighted brain MR imaging may contribute to progressive disability accumulation in MS.

In contrast with the detailed guidelines available for TSC diagnosis and management, clinical practice lacks adequate tools to evaluate the prognosis, especially in the case of in utero diagnosis. In addition, the correlation between genotypes and phenotypes remains a challenge, in part due to the large number of mutations linked to TSC. In this report, we describe a case of severe TSC diagnosed in utero and associated with a specific mutation in the gene tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2).", "251": "Initially recognised as an important factor for bone health, vitamin D is now known to have a range of effects on the immune system. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the CNS. In this review, we explore the links between vitamin D deficiency, MS risk, and disease activity. We also discuss the known immune effects of vitamin D supplementation and the relevance of these observations to the immunopathology of MS. Finally, we review the existing evidence for vitamin D supplementation as an MS therapy, highlighting several recent clinical studies and trials.", "252": "T2 blackout (TBO) effect, which is a common finding in the brains of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and older population that are imaged for other reasons on diffusion weighted imagings (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map show the existence of paramagnetic materials in the tissue. Because iron is known to accumulate in especially deep gray matter (DGM) structures in MS brains, we aimed to investigate the relationship between TBO and clinico-radiological parameters that may be iron-related in MS.", "253": "Biotin is an essential cofactor for carboxylases that regulates the energy metabolism. Recently, high-dose pharmaceutical-grade biotin (MD1003) was shown to improve clinical parameters in a subset of patients with chronic progressive multiple sclerosis. To gain insight into the mechanisms of action, we investigated the efficacy of high-dose biotin in a genetic model of chronic axonopathy caused by oxidative damage and bioenergetic failure, the Abcd1<sup>-</sup> mouse model of adrenomyeloneuropathy. High-dose biotin restored redox homeostasis driven by NRF-2, mitochondria biogenesis and ATP levels, and reversed axonal demise and locomotor impairment. Moreover, we uncovered a concerted dysregulation of the transcriptional program for lipid synthesis and degradation in the spinal cord likely driven by aberrant SREBP-1c/mTORC1signaling. This resulted in increased triglyceride levels and lipid droplets in motor neurons. High-dose biotin normalized the hyperactivation of mTORC1, thus restoring lipid homeostasis. These results shed light into the mechanism of action of high-dose biotin of relevance for neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders.", "254": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease caused by inflammatory processes in the central nervous system (CNS). Decades of research led to discovery of several disease-modifying therapeutics strategies with moderate success. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is currently the most commonly used experimental model for MS and for studying various therapeutic approaches. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive neurostimulation technique with multiple beneficial effects on healthy as well as CNS with pathology. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of rTMS on acute EAE are scarce. Our study demonstrated beneficial effects of theta-burst stimulation (TBS), an experimental paradigm of rTMS, on disease course of acute EAE. TBS treatment attenuated reactive gliosis, restored myelin sheet and down-regulated expression of vimentin in EAE rats. These effects were reflected through reduced clinical parameters, shorter duration of illness and days spent in paralysis. Based on our research, rTMS deserves further considerations for its neuroprotective effect on EAE, and is an excellent candidate for further research and points that it could be used for more than for simple symptomatic therapy.", "255": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that is caused by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Current studies have shown that Fc-receptor like-3 (FCRL3) is closely related to MS, but the specific role of FCRL3 in MS has not yet been clarified. This study further found that FCRL3 and interleukin 10 (IL-10) expression was downregulated in MS patients, but the expression of these proteins was higher in the remission phase than that in the acute phase. The C allele of rs7528684 was associated with MS, and the CC genotype could lead to the upregulation of FCRL3 expression and the increase in IL-10 secretion. Further in vitro experiments with B cells found that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) promoted FCRL3 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner, thereby promoting IL-10 secretion. LPS regulated Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) expression and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation through FCRL3, and FCRL3 upregulated the SHP-1 expression and p38 phosphorylation levels. When SHP-1 small interfering RNA or a p38 pathway inhibitor was added, the effect of FCRL3 on IL-10 secretion was significantly inhibited. In addition, FCRL3 inhibited the secretion of inflammatory factors (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8); after inhibiting the expression of IL-10, the abovementioned effects of FCRL3 were blocked. These results suggest that FCRL3 can activate the SHP-1 and p38 MAPK pathways and then promote the secretion of IL-10 in B cells, thus inhibiting the secretion of inflammatory factors. Therefore, FCRL3 may play an immunoprotective role in MS, and it will be an effective target for the diagnosis and treatment of MS.", "256": "Intrathecal IgM synthesis demonstrated either as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-restricted oligoclonal (o-) IgM bands or calculated using various formulas has been linked to more aggressive multiple sclerosis (MS) course.

CdA passes the blood-brain barrier, suggesting a potential effect on central nervous system (CNS) resident cells. We examined if CdA modifies the phenotype and function of naive and activated primary mouse microglia, when applied in the concentrations 0\u00b71-1\u00a0\u03bcM that putatively overlap human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations. Primary microglia cultures without stimulation or in the presence of proinflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or anti-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-4 were treated with different concentrations of CdA for 24\u00a0h. Viability was assessed by MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay. Phagocytotic ability and morphology were examined by flow cytometry and random migration using IncuCyte Zoom and TrackMate. Change in gene expression was examined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and protein secretion by Meso Scale Discovery. We found that LPS and IL-4 up-regulated deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) expression. Only activated microglia were affected by CdA, and this was unrelated to viability. CdA 0\u00b71-1\u00a0\u03bcM significantly reduced granularity, phagocytotic ability and random migration of activated microglia. CdA 10\u00a0\u03bcM increased the IL-4-induced gene expression of arginase 1 (Arg1) and LPS-induced expression of IL-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and Arg1, but protein secretion remained unaffected. CdA 10\u00a0\u03bcM potentiated the increased expression of anti-inflammatory TNF receptor 2 (TNF-R2) but not TNF-R1 induced by LPS. This suggests that microglia acquire a less activated phenotype when treated with 0\u00b71-1\u00a0\u03bcM CdA that putatively overlaps human CSF concentrations. This may be related to the up-regulated gene expression of DCK upon activation, and suggests a potential alternative mechanism of CdA with direct effect on CNS resident cells.", "258": "Foot drop is a reduction in ankle dorsiflexion during the swing phase of gait. We report a case of a 51-year-old recreational runner and cyclist who presented with intermittent left foot drop initially triggered by running distances in excess of 10 km. The patient was investigated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine and leg, nerve conduction studies, electromyography, and compartment pressure testing, which were all normal. Surgical release of fascia, which was restricting the common peroneal (fibular) nerve, failed to resolve her symptoms. Subsequent brain MRI revealed demyelination. This case describes the unusual case of a recreational runner presenting with exercise-induced foot drop secondary to multiple sclerosis (MS). Motor fatigability is a common feature of MS, and this case highlights the need to remain cognizant of central and peripheral causes of exertional lower limb pathology, particularly in the absence of pain.", "259": "Multiple sclerosis is one of the most common autoimmune diseases affecting the central nervous system.

The evidence for retinal layer thinning in both mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor of dementia, and delirium, a potential pre-clinical stage of neurodegenerative disorder, is unclear. We performed a systematic review of the associations, in older people, between retinal layer thickness changes (measured using OCT) and delirium or MCI compared to controls (Protocol registration ID (Prospero) CRD42019122165). We did not identify any relevant studies on delirium. This report is therefore a review of retinal nerve layer changes in mild cognitive impairment. Databases were searched using predetermined keywords such as mild cognitive impairment, retinal nerve fibre layer and delirium. Where there were sufficient data, meta-analyses were performed. Twenty-six relevant studies were identified on retinal layer thickness in people with MCI compared to controls. There was significant heterogeneity in the studies for all retinal layers investigated (retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL), ganglion cell inner plexiform layer (GCIP), foveal thickness and macular volume). Analysis of 17 studies of mean RNFL thickness in MCI (n = 622) compared to controls (n = 1154), irrespective of the type of OCT device, demonstrated a significant thinning in MCI (SMD: - 0\u00b742 and 95 % confidence interval: - 0\u00b768 to - 0\u00b716). This difference was non-significant when studies using only spectral-domain devices were analysed. Subgroup analysis of studies using spectral-domain devices in amnestic MCI diagnosed using comparable criteria, showed statistically significant thinning of RNFL in amnestic MCI (p = 0\u00b702). Meta-analysis of foveal thickness did not show a significant difference between MCI and controls. In conclusion, there is some evidence of an association between retinal nerve fibre layer thinning and MCI. We found no data on the association between RNFL and delirium.", "262": "Moderate to severe spasticity is commonly reported in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and its management is still a challenge.

Decisions regarding initiation or continuation of disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis have to consider the potential relevance to the pandemic. Understanding the mechanism of action and the possible idiosyncratic effects of each therapeutic agent on the immune system is imperative during this special time. The infectious side-effect profile as well as the route and frequency of administration of each therapeutic agent should be carefully considered when selecting a new treatment or deciding on risk mitigation strategies for existing therapy. More importantly, the impact of each agent on the future severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type-2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine should be carefully considered in treatment decisions. Moreover, some multiple sclerosis therapies may have beneficial antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 while others may have beneficial immune-modulating effects against the cytokine storm and hyperinflammatory phase of the disease. Conventional injectables have a favorable immune profile without an increased exposure risk and therefore may be suitable for mild multiple sclerosis during the pandemic. However, moderate and highly active multiple sclerosis will continue to require treatment with oral or intravenous high-potency agents but a number of risk mitigation strategies may have to be implemented. Immune-modulating therapies such as the fumerates, sphinogosine-1P modulators, and natalizumab may be anecdotally preferred over cell-depleting immunosuppressants during the pandemic from the immune profile standpoint. Within the cell-depleting agents, selective (ocrelizumab) or preferential (cladribine) depletion of B cells may be relatively safer than non-selective depletion of lymphocytes and innate immune cells (alemtuzumab). Patients who develop severe iatrogenic or idiosyncratic lymphopenia should be advised to maintain social distancing even in areas where lockdown has been removed or ameliorated. Patients with iatrogenic hypogammaglobulinemia may require prophylactic intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in certain situations. When the future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine becomes available, patients with multiple sclerosis should be advised that certain therapies may interfere with mounting a protective immune response to the vaccine and that serological confirmation of a response may be required after vaccination. They should also be aware that most multiple sclerosis therapies are incompatible with live vaccines if a live SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is developed. In this article, we review and compare disease-modifying therapies in terms of their effect on the immune system, published infection rates, potential impact on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, and vaccine-related implications.

There is currently no consensus definition for HAD, and alemtuzumab efficacy across various HAD definitions has not been explored previously.", "267": "Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory autoimmune demyelinating disease that is characterized by lesions in the central nervous system. Typically, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used for tracking disease progression. Automatic image processing methods can be used to segment lesions and derive quantitative lesion parameters. So far, methods have focused on lesion segmentation for individual MRI scans. However, for monitoring disease progression, lesion activity in terms of new and enlarging lesions between two time points is a crucial biomarker. For this problem, several classic methods have been proposed, e.g., using difference volumes. Despite their success for single-volume lesion segmentation, deep learning approaches are still rare for lesion activity segmentation. In this work, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are studied for lesion activity segmentation from two time points. For this task, CNNs are designed and evaluated that combine the information from two points in different ways. In particular, two-path architectures with attention-guided interactions are proposed that enable effective information exchange between the two time point's processing paths. It is demonstrated that deep learning-based methods outperform classic approaches and it is shown that attention-guided interactions significantly improve performance. Furthermore, the attention modules produce plausible attention maps that have a masking effect that suppresses old, irrelevant lesions. A lesion-wise false positive rate of 26.4% is achieved at a true positive rate of 74.2%, which is not significantly different from the interrater performance.", "268": "The yeast Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 is a unique, non-bacterial microorganism classified as a probiotic agent. In this review article, at first, we briefly summarized the mechanisms responsible for its probiotic properties, e.g. adhesion to and elimination of enteropathogenic microorganisms and their toxins; extracellular cleavage of pathogens' virulent factors; trophic and anti-inflammatory effects on the intestinal mucosa. The efficacy of S. boulardii administration was tested in variety of human diseases. We discussed the results of S. boulardii CNCM I-745 use in the treatment or prevention of Helicobacter pylori infections, diarrhoea (Clostridium difficile infections, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, and traveller's diarrhoea), inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, candidiasis, dyslipidemia, and small intestine bacterial overgrowth in patients with multiple sclerosis. In case of limited number of studies regarding this strain, we also presented studies demonstrating properties and efficacy of other strains of S. boulardii. Administration of S. boulardii CNCMI I-745 during antibiotic therapy has certain advantage over bacterial probiotics, because-due to its fungal natural properties-it is intrinsically resistant to the antibiotics and cannot promote the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Even though cases of fungemia following S. boulardii CNCM I-745 administration were reported, it should be treated as a widely available and safe probiotic strain.", "269": "During the last decades, obesity and autoimmune disorders have shown a parallel significant rise in industrialized countries.

We therefore established video-based setwise comparison as a fine-grained, reliable and efficient rating method of motor dysfunction using algorithmic support.<b>Materials and methods:</b> Eight neurologists rated a set of 40 multiple sclerosis patient videos of the Finger-to-Nose-Test using both the newly developed setwise comparison and the established pairwise comparison techniques, which result in a continuous rating scale. Reliability was assessed by the intra-class correlation coefficient. Construct validity was estimated as Pearson's correlation between the continuous scale and severity ratings according to the Neurostatus scale for upper-extremity tremor/dysmetria and the Nine-hole-peg-test. Comparing the time needed for ratings assessed efficiency.<b>Results:</b> Intra-class correlation coefficient was 0.83 for setwise and 0.7 for pairwise comparison. Correlation to the tremor/dysmetria score of the Neurostatus was 0.86 for both rating procedures and correlation to the Nine-hole-peg-test was 0.64 (setwise) and 0.66 (pairwise). The time needed to rate 40 videos was 22.9\u2009\u00b1\u20096.9\u2009minutes (setwise) and 77.8\u2009\u00b1\u200914.5\u2009minutes (pairwise).<b>Conclusions:</b> Setwise comparison is an efficient, valid and reliable method for fine-grained rating of motor dysfunction that can be applied to larger datasets. It is substantially more efficient than pairwise comparison.Implications for rehabilitationDisability rating is crucial in clinical neurorehabilitation and in clinical trials.Humans are naturally inconsistent in rating items on ordinal scales leading to poor intra- and interrater reliability, insensitivity to subtle differences and coarse-grained ratings.Video-based setwise comparison is a new rating method enabling fine-grained, reliable and efficient ratings of motor dysfunction using algorithmic support.", "272": "Fingolimod is an approved treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), and its properties in different pathways have raised interest in therapy research for other neurodegenerative diseases. Fingolimod is an agonist of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors. Its main pharmacologic effect is immunomodulation by lymphocyte homing, thereby reducing the numbers of T and B cells in circulation. Because of the ubiquitous expression of S1P receptors, other effects have also been described. Here, we review preclinical experiments evaluating the effects of treatment with fingolimod in neurodegenerative diseases other than MS, such as Alzheimer's disease or epilepsy. Fingolimod has shown neuroprotective effects in different animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, summarized here, correlating with increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor and improved disease phenotype (cognition and/or motor abilities). As expected, treatment also induced reductions in different neuroinflammatory markers because of not only inhibition of lymphocytes but also direct effects on astrocytes and microglia. Furthermore, fingolimod treatment exhibited additional effects for specific neurodegenerative disorders, such as reduction of amyloid-\u03b2 production, and antiepileptogenic properties. The neuroprotective effects exerted by fingolimod in these preclinical studies are reviewed and support the translation of fingolimod into clinical trials as treatment in neurodegenerative diseases beyond neuroinflammatory conditions (MS).", "273": "We aimed to evaluate optic chiasm (OC) measures as potential imaging marker for anterior optic pathway damage assessment in the context of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD).", "274": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronically progressive disease of the central nervous system.

Accumulating evidence has suggested the mode of action of FTY720 independent of an S1P modulator. In fission yeast, FTY720 induces an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ROS levels. We have previously identified 49 genes of which deletion causes FTY720 sensitivity. Here, we characterized the FTY720-sensitive mutants in terms of their relevance to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and identified the 16 FTY720- and Ca<sup>2+</sup> -sensitive mutants (fcs mutants). Most of the FTY720-sensitive mutants showed elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and exhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup> dysregulation by FTY720 treatment. One of the functional categories among the genes whose deletion renders cells susceptible to FTY720 and Ca<sup>2+</sup> include the Golgi/endosomal membrane trafficking. Notably, FTY720, but not phosphorylated FTY720 incapable of inducing Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase, inhibited the secretion of acid phosphatase in the wild-type cells. Importantly, secretory defects of the Golgi/endosomal trafficking mutants, Vps45, or Ryh1 deletion, were further exacerbated by FTY720. Our fcs mutant screen also identified the adenylyl cyclase-associated protein Cap1 and a Rictor homolog Ste20, whose deletion markedly exacerbated FTY720-sensitive secretory impairment.

However, whether and how the UPS contributes to oligodendrocyte dysfunction and repair after white matter injury (WMI) remains undefined. Here we show that the E3 ligase VHL interacts with Daam2 and their mutual antagonism regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation during development. Using proteomic analysis of the Daam2-VHL complex coupled with conditional genetic knockout mouse models, we further discovered that the E3 ubiquitin ligase <i>Nedd4</i> is required for developmental myelination through stabilization of VHL via K63-linked ubiquitination. Furthermore, studies in mouse demyelination models and white matter lesions from patients with multiple sclerosis corroborate the function of this pathway during remyelination after WMI. Overall, these studies provide evidence that a signaling axis involving key UPS components contributes to oligodendrocyte development and repair and reveal a new role for <i>Nedd4</i> in glial biology.", "278": "During axonal ensheathment, noncompact myelin channels formed at lateral edges of the myelinating process become arranged into tight paranodal spirals that resemble loops when cut in cross section. These adhere to the axon, concentrating voltage-dependent sodium channels at nodes of Ranvier and patterning the surrounding axon into distinct molecular domains. The signals responsible for forming and maintaining the complex structure of paranodal myelin are poorly understood. Here, we test the hypothesis that the planar cell polarity determinant Vangl2 organizes paranodal myelin. We show that Vangl2 is concentrated at paranodes and that, following conditional knockout of Vangl2 in oligodendrocytes, the paranodal spiral loosens, accompanied by disruption to the microtubule cytoskeleton and mislocalization of autotypic adhesion molecules between loops within the spiral. Adhesion of the spiral to the axon is unaffected. This results in disruptions to axonal patterning at nodes of Ranvier, paranodal axon diameter and conduction velocity. When taken together with our previous work showing that loss of the apico-basal polarity protein Scribble has the opposite phenotype-loss of axonal adhesion but no effect on loop-loop autotypic adhesion-our results identify a novel mechanism by which polarity proteins control the shape of nodes of Ranvier and regulate conduction in the CNS.", "279": "Genetic and functional analyses of the inflammasome suggest a role for this multiprotein complex in the biological mechanisms leading to the onset and progression of multiple sclerosis (MS). Nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors trigger the activation and assembly of specific inflammasomes in response to danger signals. Mining exome sequencing data from 326 MS patients identified 17 rare missense or nonsense variants in NLR family pyrin domain containing 1 (NLRP1), NLRP3, NLRP6, NLRP7 and NLR family CARD domain containing 4 (NLRC4). Genotyping these variants in 2503 MS cases and 1076 healthy controls did not result in statistically significant differences between groups, and segregation analysis within MS families was largely unsupportive of co-segregation of these variants with disease. However, the identification of MS patients harboring rare homozygote variants in NLRP1 (p.Ile601Phe and p.Ser1387Ile), a variant in NLRP3 (p.Leu832Ile) resulting in the substitution of a critical amino acid for the formation of its leucine-rich repeat domain, and several MS patients with NLRC4 variants (p.Arg310Ter and p.Glu600Ter) causing protein truncations suggest that rare protein-altering variants in inflammasome-activating NLR receptors may contribute to MS risk.", "280": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammatory infiltration, demyelination and axonal injury. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent which can not only differentiate into many types of cells, but also have immunomodulatory effects.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the immunologic mechanism by which BM-MSC transplantation ameliorates EAE involves inhibiting the proliferation and activation of T cells, reducing the production of inflammatory cytokines, and regulating macrophage responses, especially the macrophage polarization. The findings broaden our understanding about the regulation of T cell and macrophage immune responses by MSC transplantation.", "281": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Atherosclerosis is among the leading causes of AMI. The rupture or erosion of atherosclerotic plaques can obstruct coronary arteries, thereby leading to an acute inflammatory reaction to ischemic injury and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is a fumaric acid diester which is used for the treatment of psoriasis and multiple sclerosis. DMF is most well-known for its modulatory actions on the Nrf2 and NF-\u03baB cellular signaling pathways. In the present study, we employed an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury using H9c2 cardiomyocytes to assess the potential protective effects of DMF. We found that DMF significantly improved cell viability and reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1. We further demonstrated an antioxidant effect of DMF via reduced production of ROS, which was mediated through NOX4 inhibition. Tissue factor and ICAM-1 play a major role in left ventricular remodeling. DMF inhibited the expression of TF and ICAM-1 induced by OGD/R, which we demonstrated to be mediated through the Egr-1 signaling pathway, as silencing of Egr-1 suppressed the expression of TF and ICAM-1. Together, these findings demonstrate a potential role for DMF in the treatment of myocardial infarction.", "282": "The inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)\u20111\u03b2 has been implicated in demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and brain degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the damaging effects of IL\u20111\u03b2 on myelination are poorly understood. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate whether IL\u20111\u03b2 modifies the proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) through regulating the miR\u2011202\u20113p/\u03b2\u2011catenin/glioma\u2011associated oncogene homolog 1 (Gli1) axis. It was observed that IL\u20111\u03b2 significantly attenuated the proliferation and differentiation of OPCs, as evidenced by a decrease in bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and reduced percentage of myelin basic protein\u2011positive cells among the total number of oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2\u2011positive cells. In addition, IL\u20111\u03b2 markedly decreased the expression of miR\u2011202\u20113p and increased the protein expression of \u03b2\u2011catenin and Gli1, all of which were reversed by the IL\u20111\u03b2 inhibitor, IL\u20111Ra. Treatment with the \u03b2\u2011catenin inhibitor XAV939, Gli1 siRNA, or miR\u2011202\u20113p mimic transfection, attenuated the IL\u20111\u03b2\u2011induced suppression of OPC proliferation and differentiation. Treatment with XAV939 decreased the expression of Gli1. Transfection of miR\u2011202\u20113p mimic attenuated the expression of \u03b2\u2011catenin and Gli1.

Therefore, the miR\u2011202\u20113p/\u03b2\u2011catenin/Gli1 axis may be of value as a therapeutic target in multiple sclerosis.", "283": "The use of the Nintendo Wii system has become a common tool for balance rehabilitation in patients with multiple sclerosis, but few studies verified the effectiveness of such an approach using quantitative measures of postural control. We aimed to evaluate the impact of rehabilitation treatment using the Nintendo Wii Fit Plus balance program on objective stabilometric parameters in multiple sclerosis patients. We enrolled 36 multiple sclerosis patients, with mild-moderate disability, referring to the multiple sclerosis Centre of the University of Catania from September 2013 to June 2014. Twenty participants underwent 20 individual sessions of balance exercise using the Nintendo Wii Fit Plus. They were assessed at baseline (T0) and at the end of rehabilitation program (T1) by Neurocom Balance Manager. Functional independence measure, Barthel index, and Berg balance scale were also administered. At T1, we found a significant improvement in total path length-open eyes, sway area-open eyes, and mean sway velocity-open eyes. Patients showed significant improvement in functional independence measure motor score, Barthel index, and in Berg balance scale. No significant differences between T0 and T1 in closed eyes trials were found. A significant correlation between delta values between T0 and T1 of sway area-open eyes and the Berg balance scale (r = -0.76; P < 0.0001) was found. This study confirmed that balance rehabilitation training performed using the Nintendo Wii with balance board significantly reduced some postural sway parameters in multiple sclerosis patients. It could be a good support to standard rehabilitation program in multiple sclerosis patients.", "284": "Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune idiopathic connective tissue disease, characterized by aberrant fibro-proliferative and inflammatory responses, causing fibrosis of multiple organs. In recent years the interactions between innate and adaptive immune cells with resident fibroblasts have been uncovered. Cross-talk between immune and stromal cells mediates activation of stromal cells to myofibroblasts; key cells in the pathophysiology of fibrosis. These cells and their cytokines appear to mediate their effects in both a paracrine and autocrine fashion. This review examines the role of innate and adaptive immune cells in SSc, focusing on recent advances that have illuminated our understanding of ongoing bi-directional communication between immune and stromal cells. Finally, we appraise current and future therapies and how these may be useful in a disease that currently has no specific disease modifying treatment.", "285": "Autoimmune diseases are common diseases of the immune system that are characterized by the loss of self-tolerance and the production of autoantibodies; the breakdown of immune tolerance and the prolonged inflammatory reaction are undisputedly core steps in the initiation and maintenance of autoimmunity. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-dependent transcription factors that belong to the nuclear hormone receptor family and act as ligand-activated transcription factors. There are three different isotypes of PPARs: PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b3, and PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4. PPAR\u03b3 is an established regulator of glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism. Recent studies have demonstrated that PPAR\u03b3 exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in multiple disease models. PPAR\u03b3 can also modulate the activation and polarization of macrophages, regulate the function of dendritic cells and mediate T cell survival, activation, and differentiation. In this review, we summarize the signaling pathways and biological functions of PPAR\u03b3 and focus on how PPAR\u03b3 and its agonists play protective roles in autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune thyroid diseases, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, primary Sjogren syndrome and primary biliary cirrhosis.", "286": "Tumefactive demyelinating lesions are an uncommon manifestation of demyelinating disease that mimic primary central nervous system neoplasms and can pose a diagnostic challenge in patients without a pre-existing diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Although a biopsy may be required to distinguish TDL from neoplasms or infection, certain ancillary and radiographic findings may preclude the need for invasive diagnostic procedures. We describe the case of a 15-year-old boy with a tumefactive demyelinating lesion involving the conus medullaris. An exhaustive systematic literature search of pediatric cases of TDL yielded an additional 78 cases. This review summarizes the current knowledge and recommendations for the diagnosis and management of this condition, highlighting the clinical, demographic, and radiologic features of 79 reported cases, including our own.

It is an analog of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and targets S1P receptors 1, 3, 4, and 5. Recent reports indicate an association between long-term exposure to FTY720 and cases of cryptococcal infection. Here, we studied the effect of FTY720 and its derivative, BAF312, which only target S1P receptors 1 and 5, in a mouse model of cryptococcal infection. We found that treatment with FTY720, but not with BAF312, led to decreased survival and increased organ burden in mouse cryptococcal granulomas. Both FTY720 and BAF312 caused a profound CD4+ and CD8+ T cell depletion in blood and lungs but only treatment with FTY720 led to cryptococcal reactivation. Treatment with FTY720, but not with BAF312, was associated with disorganization of macrophages and with M2 polarization at the granuloma site. In a cell system, FTY720 decreased phagocytosis and production of reactive oxygen species by macrophages, a phenotype recapitulated in the S1pr3-/- knockout macrophages. Our results suggest that FTY720 reactivates cryptococcosis from the granuloma through a S1P receptor 3-mediated mechanism and support the rationale for development of more-specific receptor modulators for therapeutic use of MS.", "289": "Chronic hyperammonemia induces neuroinflammation which mediates cognitive impairment.

As the respiratory tract connects to the brain without protection of the blood-brain barrier, SARS-CoV-2 might in the early invasive phase attack the cardiorespiratory centres located in the medulla/pons areas, giving rise to disturbances of respiration and cardiac problems. Furthermore, brainstem regions are at risk to lose their functional integrity. Therefore, long-term neurological as well as psychiatric symptomatology and eventual respective disorders cannot be excluded as evidenced from influenza-A triggered post-encephalitic Parkinsonism and HIV-1 triggered AIDS-dementia complex. From the available evidences for coronavirus-induced brain pathology, this review concludes a number of unmet needs for further research strategies like human postmortem brain analyses. SARS-CoV-2 mirroring experimental animal brain studies, characterization of time-dependent and region-dependent spreading behaviours of coronaviruses, enlightening of pathological mechanisms after coronavirus infection using long-term animal models and clinical observations of patients having had COVID-19 infection are calling to develop both protective strategies and drug discoveries to avoid early and late coronavirus-induced functional brain disturbances, symptoms and eventually disorders.

However, this knowledge is limited. The present study aims to summarize previous studies by performing a systematic review and meta-analyses. The terms \"multiple sclerosis\" combined with DMDs of interest and a broad profile for pregnancy terms were used to search Embase and Medline databases to identify relevant studies published from January 2000 to July 2019.1260 studies were identified and ten studies met our inclusion criteria. Pooled risk ratios (RR) of pregnancy and birth outcomes in pregnancies exposed to DMDs compared to those not exposed were calculated using a random effects model. For spontaneous abortion RR\u2009=\u20091.14, 95% CI 0.99-1.32, for preterm births RR\u2009=\u20090.93, 95% CI 0.72-1.21 and for major congenital malformations RR\u2009=\u20090.86, 95% CI 0.47-1.56. The most common major congenital malformations reported in MS patients exposed to MS drugs were atrial septal defect (ASD) (N\u2009=\u20094), polydactyly (N\u2009=\u20094) and club foot (N\u2009=\u20093), which are among the most prevalent birth defects observed in the general population. In conclusion, interferons, glatiramer acetate or natalizumab, do not appear to increase the risk for spontaneous abortions, pre-term birth or major congenital malformations. There were very few patients included that were exposed to fingolimod, azathioprine and rituximab; therefore, these results cannot be generalized across drugs.

In the inherited forms of these diseases, the disease-causing mutation is present from birth but symptoms appear decades later. This indicates that these mutations are well tolerated in younger individuals but not in older adults. Based on this observation, we hypothesized that changes taking place during normal aging make the cells in the brain (and elsewhere) susceptible to the disease-causing mutations. If so, then delaying some of these age-related changes may be beneficial in the treatment of neurodegenerative disease. In this review, we examine the effects of five compounds that have been shown to extend longevity (metformin, rapamycin, resveratrol, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, curcumin) in four of the most common neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). While not all investigations observe a beneficial effect of these compounds, there are multiple studies that show a protective effect of each of these lifespan-extending compounds in animal models of neurodegenerative disease. Combined with genetic studies, this suggests the possibility that targeting the aging process may be an effective strategy to treat neurodegenerative disease.", "301": "The segmentation of the lesion plays a core role in diagnosis and monitoring of multiple sclerosis (MS). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most frequent image modality used to evaluate such lesions. Because of the massive amount of data, manual segmentation cannot be achieved within a sensible time that restricts the usage of accurate quantitative measurement in clinical practice. Therefore, the need for effective automated segmentation techniques is critical. However, a large spatial variability between the structure of brain lesions makes it more challenging. Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN), in particular, the region-based CNN (R-CNN), have attained tremendous progress within the field of object recognition because of its ability to learn and represent features. CNN has proven a last-breaking performance in various fields, such as object recognition, and has also gained more attention in brain imaging, especially in tissue and brain segmentation. In this paper, an automated technique for MS lesion segmentation is proposed, which is built on a 3D patch-wise R-CNN. The proposed system includes two stages: first, segmenting MS lesions in T2-w and FLAIR sequences using R-CNN, then an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is applied to fuse the results of the two modalities. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the public MICCAI2008 MS challenge dataset is employed to segment MS lesions. The experimental results show competitive results of the proposed method compared with the state-of-the-art MS lesion segmentation methods with an average total score of 83.25 and an average sensitivity of 61.8% on the MICCAI2008 testing set. Graphical Abstract The proposed system overview. First, the input of two modalities FLAIR and T2 are pre-processed to remove the skull and correct the bias field. Then 3D patches for lesion and non-lesion tissues are extracted and fed to R-CNN. Each R-CNN produces a probability map of the segmentation result that provides to ANFIS to fuse the results and obtain the final MS lesion segmentation. The MS lesions are shown on a pre-processed FLAIR image.", "302": "Compelling evidence has demonstrated that Th17 cells play an essential role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been confirmed as vital regulators of immune cell differentiation and other functions. However, whether and how lncRNAs influence Th17 cell differentiation and functional behaviors remain largely unclear. Here, we identified that a lncRNA, namely Gm15575, is specifically enriched in Th17 cells and spleen tissues of EAE mice. Functionally, knockdown of Gm15575 in Th17 cells suppressed the secretion of IL17A. Mechanistically, Gm15575 served as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to block the function of miR-686, positively regulating the expression of CCL7, a pro-inflammatory chemokine with high expression in Th17 cells, and Th17 differentiation. Taken together, our study revealed that Gm15575-miR-686 axis promoted the progression of EAE by regulating Th17 differentiation and expression of CCL7 which elucidated the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases at genetic level. Gm15575 can be involved in the course of Th17-related autoimmune diseases.", "303": "Similar to its predecessors, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibits neurotrophic properties, which lead to progression of neurologic sequelae. Besides direct viral invasion to the central nervous system (CNS), indirect CNS involvement through viral-mediated immune response is plausible. Aberrant immune pathways such as extreme release of cytokines (cytokine storm), autoimmunity mediated by cross-reactivity between CNS components and viral particles, and microglial activation propagate CNS damage in these patients. Here, we review the currently available evidence to discuss the plausible immunologic pathways that may contribute to the development of COVID-19 neurological complications, namely Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, seizure, and brainstem involvement.", "304": "Blood-brain barrier disruption is one of the hallmarks of multiple sclerosis. Mesenchymal stem cells showed great potential for the multiple sclerosis therapy. However, the effect of mesenchymal stem cells on blood-brain barrier in multiple sclerosis remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether mesenchymal stem cells transplantation protected blood-brain barrier integrity and further explored possible underlying mechanisms. Adult female C57BL/6 mice were immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide33-55 (MOG33-55) to induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Mesenchymal stem cells (5\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>5</sup>) were transplanted via tail vein at disease onset. In the cell culture, we examined lipopolysaccharide-induced AQP4 upregulation in astrocytes. Results indicated that mesenchymal stem cells therapy improved neurobehavioral outcomes in EAE mice, reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, IgG protein leakage, and demyelination in spinal cord. Mesenchymal stem cells therapy also increased tight junction protein expression. In addition, mesenchymal stem cells downregulated AQP4 and A<sub>2B</sub> adenosine receptor (A<sub>2B</sub>AR) expression in EAE mice in spinal cord. We found that MSCs-conditioned medium (MCM) reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines, AQP4 and A<sub>2B</sub>AR in lipopolysaccharide-activated astrocytes. BAY-60-6583 (a selective A<sub>2B</sub>AR agonist) reversed the MCM-induced AQP4 downregulation and increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Furthermore, the upregulation effects of A<sub>2B</sub>AR agonist were eliminated when treated with p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. Thus, we concluded that mesenchymal stem cells alleviated blood-brain barrier disruption by downregulating AQP4 in multiple sclerosis, possibly through inhibiting the A<sub>2B</sub>AR/p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Our work suggests that mesenchymal stem cells exert beneficial effect through maintaining blood-brain barrier integrity in EAE mice.", "305": "Concerns regarding infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 leading to COVID-19 are particularly marked for pregnant women with autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS).

Studies of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (an animal model of multiple sclerosis)<sup>2,3</sup>, as well as human studies<sup>4-6</sup>, have implicated gut microorganisms in the development or severity of multiple sclerosis. However, it remains unclear how gut microorganisms act on the inflammation of extra-intestinal tissues such as the spinal cord. Here we show that two distinct signals from gut microorganisms coordinately activate autoreactive T cells in the small intestine that respond specifically to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). After induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice, MOG-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are observed in the small intestine. Experiments using germ-free mice that were monocolonized with microorganisms from the small intestine demonstrated that a newly isolated strain in the family Erysipelotrichaceae acts similarly to an adjuvant to enhance the responses of T helper 17 cells. Shotgun sequencing of the contents of the small intestine revealed a strain of Lactobacillus reuteri that possesses peptides that potentially mimic MOG. Mice that were co-colonized with these two strains showed experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis symptoms that were more severe than those of germ-free or monocolonized mice. These data suggest that the synergistic effects that result from the presence of these microorganisms should be considered in the pathogenicity of multiple sclerosis, and that further study of these microorganisms may lead to preventive strategies for this disease.", "319": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is characterized by a combination of inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes in the spinal cord and the brain. Natural and synthetic cannabinoids such as VCE-004.8 have been studied in preclinical models of MS and represent promising candidates for drug development.

EHP-101 is an oral lipidic formulation of VCE-004.8 that has shown efficacy in several preclinical models of autoimmune, inflammatory, fibrotic, and neurodegenerative diseases. EHP-101 alleviated clinical symptomatology in EAE and transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that EHP-101 prevented the expression of many inflammatory genes closely associated with MS pathophysiology in the spinal cord. EHP-101 normalized the expression of several genes associated with oligodendrocyte function such as Teneurin 4 (Tenm4) and Gap junction gamma-3 (Gjc3) that were downregulated in EAE. EHP-101 treatment prevented microglia activation and demyelination in both the spinal cord and the brain. Moreover, EAE was associated with a loss in the expression of Oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (Olig2) in the corpus callosum, a marker for oligodendrocyte differentiation, which was restored by EHP-101 treatment. In addition, EHP-101 enhanced the expression of glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTpi), a marker for mature oligodendrocytes in the brain. We also found that a diet containing 0.2% cuprizone for six weeks induced a clear loss of myelin in the brain measured by Cryomyelin staining and Myelin basic protein (MBP) expression.

Diagnosis delivery can be especially difficult for individuals with neurodegenerative diseases such as motor neurone disease (MND), multiple sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson's disease (PD).

A common factor in all neuropathologies is the central role of microglia, the intrinsic immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS). Microglia are activated in pathology and can have both pro- and anti-inflammatory functions. Here, we examined the effects of the flavonoid agathisflavone on microglia and remyelination in the cerebellar slice model following lysolecithin induced demyelination. Notably, agathisflavone enhances remyelination and alters microglial activation state, as determined by their morphology and cytokine profile. Furthermore, these effects of agathisflavone on remyelination and microglial activation were inhibited by blockade of estrogen receptor \u03b1. Thus, our results identify agathisflavone as a novel compound that may act via ER to regulate microglial activation and enhance remyelination and repair.", "332": "ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters represent one of the largest and most diverse superfamily of proteins in living species, playing an important role in many biological processes such as cell homeostasis, cell signaling, drug metabolism and nutrient uptake. Moreover, using the energy generated from ATP hydrolysis, they mediate the efflux of endogenous and exogenous substrates from inside the cells, thereby reducing their intracellular accumulation. At present, 48 ABC transporters have been identified in humans, which were classified into 7 different subfamilies (A to G) according to their phylogenetic analysis. Nevertheless, the most studied members with importance in drug therapeutic efficacy and toxicity include P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a member of the ABCB subfamily, the multidrug-associated proteins (MPRs), members of the ABCC subfamily, and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), a member of the ABCG subfamily. They exhibit ubiquitous expression throughout the human body, with a special relevance in barrier tissues like the blood-brain barrier (BBB). At this level, they play a physiological function in tissue protection by reducing or limiting the brain accumulation of neurotoxins. Furthermore, dysfunction of ABC transporters, at expression and/or activity level, has been associated with many neurological diseases, including epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Additionally, these transporters are strikingly associated with the pharmacoresistance to central nervous system (CNS) acting drugs, because they contribute to the decrease in drug bioavailability. This article reviews the signaling pathways that regulate the expression and activity of P-gp, BCRP and MRPs subfamilies of transporters, with particular attention at the BBB level, and their mis-regulation in neurological disorders.", "333": "The tremendous heterogeneity of the human population presents a major obstacle in understanding how autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS) contribute to variations in human peripheral immune signatures. To minimize heterogeneity, we made use of a unique cohort of 43 monozygotic twin pairs clinically discordant for MS and searched for disease-related peripheral immune signatures in a systems biology approach covering a broad range of adaptive and innate immune populations on the protein level. Despite disease discordance, the immune signatures of MS-affected and unaffected cotwins were remarkably similar. Twinship alone contributed 56% of the immune variation, whereas MS explained 1 to 2% of the immune variance. Notably, distinct traits in CD4<sup>+</sup> effector T cell subsets emerged when we focused on a subgroup of twins with signs of subclinical, prodromal MS in the clinically healthy cotwin. Some of these early-disease immune traits were confirmed in a second independent cohort of untreated early relapsing-remitting MS patients. Early involvement of effector T cell subsets thus points to a key role of T cells in MS disease initiation.", "334": "Given the known neuroreparative actions of IL-33 in experimental models of central nervous system (CNS) injury, we predicted that compounds which induce IL-33 are likely to promote remyelination. We found anacardic acid as a candidate molecule to serve as a therapeutic agent to promote remyelination. Addition of anacardic acid to cultured oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) rapidly increased expression of myelin genes and myelin proteins, suggesting a direct induction of genes involved in myelination by anacardic acid. Also, when added to OPCs, anacardic acid resulted in the induction of IL-33. In vivo, treatment of with anacardic acid in doses which ranged from 0.025 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg<i>,</i> improved pathologic scores in experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE) and in the cuprizone model of demyelination/remyelination. Electron microscopic studies performed in mice fed with cuprizone and treated with anacardic acid showed lower g-ratio scores when compared to controls, suggesting increased remyelination of axons. In EAE, improvement in paralytic scores was seen when the drug was given prior to or following the onset of paralytic signs. In EAE and in the cuprizone model, areas of myelin loss, which are likely to remyelinate, was associated with a greater recruitment of IL-33-expressing OPCs in mice which received anacardic acid when compared to controls.", "335": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), with characteristic inflammatory lesions and demyelination. The clinical benefit of cell-depleting therapies targeting CD20 has emphasized the role of B cells and autoantibodies in MS pathogenesis. We previously introduced an enzyme-linked immunospot spot (ELISpot)-based assay to measure CNS antigen-specific B cells in the blood of MS patients and demonstrated its usefulness as a predictive biomarker for disease activity in measuring the successful outcome of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). Here we used a planar protein array to investigate CNS-reactive antibodies in the serum of MS patients as well as in B cell culture supernatants after polyclonal stimulation. Anti-CNS antibody reactivity was evident in the sera of the MS cohort, and the antibodies bound a heterogeneous set of molecules, including myelin, axonal cytoskeleton, and ion channel antigens, in individual patients. Immunoglobulin reactivity in supernatants of stimulated B cells was directed against a broad range of CNS antigens. A group of MS patients with a highly active B cell component was identified by the ELISpot assay. Those antibody reactivities remained stable over time. These assays with protein arrays identify MS patients with a highly active B cell population with antibodies directed against a swathe of CNS proteins.", "336": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common human demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. The IL-12 family of cytokines has four members, which are IL-12 (p40:p35), IL-23 (p40:p19), the p40 monomer (p40), and the p40 homodimer (p40<sub>2</sub>). Since all four members contain p40 in different forms, it is important to use a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) to characterize these molecules. Here, by using such mAbs, we describe selective loss of p40 in serum of MS patients as compared to healthy controls. Similarly, we also observed decrease in p40 and increase in IL-12, IL-23, and p40<sub>2</sub> in serum of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, as compared to control mice. Interestingly, weekly supplementation of mouse and human recombinant p40 ameliorated clinical symptoms and disease progression of EAE. On the other hand, IL-12, IL-23, and p40<sub>2</sub> did not exhibit such inhibitory effect. In addition to EAE, p40 also suppressed collagen-induced arthritis in mice. Using IL-12R\u03b21<sup>-/-</sup>, IL-12R\u03b22<sup>-/-</sup>, and IL-12R\u03b21<sup>+/-</sup>/IL-12R\u03b22<sup>-/-</sup> mice, we observed that p40 required IL-12R\u03b21, but not IL-12R\u03b22, to suppress EAE. Interestingly, p40 arrested IL-12-, IL-23-, or p40<sub>2</sub>-mediated internalization of IL-12R\u03b21, but neither IL-12R\u03b22 nor IL-23R, protected regulatory T cells, and suppressed Th1 and Th17 biasness. These studies identify p40 as an anti-autoimmune cytokine with a biological role different from IL-12, IL-23, and p40<sub>2</sub> in which it attenuates autoimmune signaling via suppression of IL-12R\u03b21 internalization, which may be beneficial in patients with MS and other autoimmune disorders.", "337": "While many studies have examined the impacts of multiple sclerosis (MS) on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), none have used the SF-6D multi-attribute utility instrument in a large international cohort (>\u20092000 subjects) of people with MS.", "338": "Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (panNENs) are heterogeneous neoplasms with neuroendocrine differentiation that show characteristic clinical, histomorphologic, and prognostic features; genetic alterations; and biologic behavior. Up to 10% of panNENs develop in patients with syndromes that predispose them to cancer, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, von Hippel-Lindau disease, tuberous sclerosis complex, neurofibromatosis type 1, and glucagon cell adenomatosis. PanNENs are classified as either functioning tumors, which manifest early because of clinical symptoms related to increased hormone production, or nonfunctioning tumors, which often manifest late because of mass effect. PanNENs are histopathologically classified as well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (panNETs) or poorly differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas (panNECs) according to the 2010 World Health Organization (WHO) classification system. Recent advances in cytogenetics and molecular biology have shown substantial heterogeneity in panNECs, and a new tumor subtype, well-differentiated, high-grade panNET, has been introduced. High-grade panNETs and panNECs are two distinct entities with different pathogenesis, clinical features, imaging findings, treatment options, and prognoses. The 2017 WHO classification system and the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system include substantial changes.

Comprehensive, multiparametric MRI studies are useful in this perspective, but studies for the spinal cord are lacking. Purpose To identify MRI features of cervical spinal cord damage that could help predict disability and disease course in MS by using a comprehensive, multiparametric MRI approach. Materials and Methods In this retrospective hypothesis-driven analysis of longitudinally acquired data between June 2017 and April 2019, 120 patients with MS (58 with relapsing-remitting MS [RRMS] and 62 with progressive MS [PMS]) and 30 age- and sex-matched healthy control participants underwent 3.0-T MRI of the brain and cervical spinal cord. Cervical spinal cord MRI was performed with three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and diffusion-weighted imaging; sagittal two-dimensional (2D) short inversion time inversion-recovery imaging; and axial 2D phase-sensitive inversion-recovery imaging at the C2-C3 level. Brain MRI was performed with 3D T1-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery and T2-weighted sequences. Associations between MRI variables and disability were explored with age-, sex- and phenotype-adjusted linear models. Results In patients with MS, multivariable analysis identified phenotype, cervical spinal cord gray matter (GM) cross-sectional area (CSA), lateral funiculi fractional anisotropy (FA), and brain GM volume as independent predictors of Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score (<i>R</i><sup>\n                        <i>2</i>\n                    </sup> = 0.86). The independent predictors of EDSS score in RRMS were lateral funiculi FA, normalized brain volume, and cervical spinal cord GM T2 lesion volume (<i>R</i><sup>\n                        <i>2</i>\n                    </sup> = 0.51). The independent predictors of EDSS score in PMS were cervical spinal cord GM CSA and brain GM volume (<i>R</i><sup>\n                        <i>2</i>\n                    </sup> = 0.44). Logistic regression analysis identified cervical spinal cord GM CSA and T2 lesion volume as independent predictors of phenotype (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.95). An optimal cervical spinal cord GM CSA cut-off value of 11.1 mm<sup>2</sup> was found to enable accurate differentiation of patients with PMS, having values below the threshold, from those with RRMS (sensitivity = 90% [56 of 62], specificity = 91% [53 of 58]). Conclusion Cervical spinal cord MRI involvement has a central role in explaining disability in multiple sclerosis (MS): Lesion-induced damage in the lateral funiculi and gray matter (GM) in relapsing-remitting MS and GM atrophy in patients with progressive MS are the most relevant variables. Cervical spinal cord GM atrophy is an accurate predictor of progressive phenotype. Cervical spinal cord GM lesions may subsequently cause GM atrophy, which may contribute to evolution to PMS. \u00a9\u2009RSNA, 2020 <i>Online supplemental material is available for this article.</i> See also the editorial by Zivadinov and Bergsland in this issue.", "341": "The case of a 13-year-old girl who presented a recurrence of left retrobulbar optic neuritis, 3 years after the previous episode, is described.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. It is widely recognized that a reduction of Foxp3+\u00a0regulatory T (Treg) cells is an immunological hallmark of MS, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In experimental autoimmune models, N-Ras and K-Ras inhibition triggers an anti-inflammatory effect up-regulating, <i>via</i> foxp3 elevation, the numbers and the functional suppressive properties of Tregs. Similarly, an increase in natural Tregs number during Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) in <i>R-RAS</i> -/- mice results in attenuated disease. In humans, only <i>KRAS</i> GTPase isoform is involved in mechanism causing tolerance defects in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). T cells from these patients have increased transcription of <i>KRAS</i> (but not <i>NRAS</i>). <i>RAS</i> genes are major drivers in human cancers. Consequently, there has been considerable interest in developing anti-RAS inhibitors for cancer treatment. Despite efforts, no anti-RAS therapy has succeeded in the clinic. The major strategy that has so far reached the clinic aimed to inhibit activated Ras indirectly through blocking its post-translational modification and inducing its mis-localization. The disappointing clinical outcome of Farnesyl Transferase Inhibitors (FTIs) in cancers has decreased interest in these drugs. However, FTIs suppress EAE by downregulation of myelin-reactive activated T-lymphocytes and statins are currently studied in clinical trials for MS. However, no pharmacologic approaches to targeting Ras proteins directly have yet succeeded. The therapeutic strategy to recover immune function through the restoration of impaired Tregs function with the mounting evidences regarding <i>KRAS</i> in autoimmune mediated disorder (MS, SLE, RA, T1D) suggest as working hypothesis the direct targeting <i>KRAS</i> activation using cancer-derived small molecules may be clinically relevant.", "349": "Several modeling approaches have been developed to quantify differences in multiple sclerosis lesion evolution on magnetic resonance imaging to identify the effect of treatment on disease progression.

It has been argued that active bilingualism may significantly contribute to the delaying of the expression of Alzheimer's disease symptoms. If bilingualism plays an ameliorative role against the expression of neurodegeneration in dementia, it is possible that it could have similar effects for other neurodegenerative disorders, including Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's and Huntington's Diseases. To date, however, direct relevant evidence remains limited, not least because the necessary scientific motivations for investigating this with greater depth have not yet been fully articulated. Herein, we provide a roadmap that reviews the relevant literatures, highlighting potential links across neurodegenerative disorders and bilingualism more generally.", "363": "Vitamin B1, or thiamine, is one of the most relevant vitamins in obtaining energy for the nervous system. Thiamine deficiency or lack of activity causes neurological manifestations, especially symptoms of depression, intrinsic to multiple sclerosis (MS) and related to its pathogenesis. On this basis, the aim of this study was to determine the possible relationship between the nutritional habits of patients with MS and the presence of depression. Therefore, a cross-sectional and observational descriptive study was conducted. An analysis of dietary habits and vitamin B1 consumption in a Spanish population of 51 MS patients was performed by recording the frequency of food consumption. Results showed a vitamin B1 intake within the established range, mainly provided by the consumption of ultra-processed products such as cold meats or pastries, and a total carbohydrate consumption lower than recommended, which stands out for its high content of simple carbohydrates deriving from processed foods such as dairy desserts, juice, snacks, pastries, chocolate bars, soft drinks and fermented alcohol. In addition, a significant negative correlation between depression and the intake of thiamine and total carbohydrates was observed. These findings could explain the influence of MS patients' eating habits, and consequently vitamin B1 activity, on depression levels.", "364": "There is an increasing interest in the intestinal microbiota as a critical regulator of the development and function of the immune, nervous, and endocrine systems. Experimental work in animal models has provided the foundation for clinical studies to investigate associations between microbiota composition and function and human disease, including multiple sclerosis (MS). Initial work done using an animal model of brain inflammation, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), suggests the existence of a microbiota-gut-brain axis connection in the context of MS, and microbiome sequence analyses reveal increases and decreases of microbial taxa in MS intestines. In this review, we discuss the impact of the intestinal microbiota on the immune system and the role of the microbiome-gut-brain axis in the neuroinflammatory disease MS. We also discuss experimental evidence supporting the hypothesis that modulating the intestinal microbiota through genetically modified probiotics may provide immunomodulatory and protective effects as a novel therapeutic approach to treat this devastating disease.", "365": "Lymphedema are characterized by interstitial edema leading to swelling of extremities. They can be divided into primary and secondary lymphedema. Developmental abnormalities of the lymphatic system are responsible for the primary form of lymphedema. The secondary form of lymphedema is caused by damage of the lymphatic system due to external factors. Lymphedema can rarely be observed in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), which is a neurocutaneous syndrome caused by pathogenic variants in the genes TSC1 or TSC2. Patients with TSC usually present with neurological manifestations and the development of multiple benign tumors of ectodermal origin. Typical onset for several symptoms is during the first year of life and in some cases lesions can be detected prenatally. Epilepsy is one of the most common manifestations, affecting up to 90% of TSC patients, and is associated with developmental delay. Early pharmacotherapy improves long term patient outcome. Trio exome sequencing was performed in a 3\u00a0weeks old girl with congenital lymphedema of the right lower extremity. Using a filter for de novo variants, the heterozygous missense variant c.2524C>T, p.(Gln842Ter) in TSC1 (NM_000368.4) could be identified. After the first onset of infantile spams at age 7\u00a0months treatment with vigabatrin was started immediately. We propose to include TSC1 and TSC2 analysis in the diagnostic work-up of patients with (isolated) congenital lymphedema as early diagnosis facilitates consequent treatment strategies potentially improving the prognosis of TSC patients.", "366": "Tolerance inducing vaccines have re-appeared in recent years as a mean to re-establish immunological tolerance in the context of autoimmune disease. In the case of multiple sclerosis, several myelin-related peptides have been identified. The use of microneedles (MNs) allows the painless administration of molecules to the epidermal and intradermal space. This approach has been considered particularly promising in the scope of vaccination as the skin represents an immunologically super-active organ. This work explores the preparation of a MN patch that can deliver immunologically active peptides foreseeing the establishment of tolerance in the context of multiple sclerosis. A new MN design was achieved by microfabrication. The patches are composed of a dense MN array containing 33\u00a0\u00d7\u00a033 needles with 200 or 125\u00a0\u00b5m diameter and height around 600\u00a0\u00b5m. Polymeric MNs composed by poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) and chitosan were successfully obtained, replicating the silicon masters morphology. The polymer MN patches showed to perforate pig skin, reaching more than 400\u00a0\u00b5m depth of penetration when assessed using agarose as a model for the skin viscoelastic properties. The MNs with 200\u00a0\u00b5m diameter showed improved mechanical properties in comparison to 125\u00a0\u00b5m diameter MNs. The presence of chitosan in the MN structure was explored and found not to affect mechanical properties or significantly alter the drug loading or release profile. The immunomodulatory peptide associated with the proteolipid protein PLP<sub>139-151</sub> was loaded in 200\u00a0\u00b5m diameter MN patch and it is released in physiological conditions at therapeutic doses of the peptide, putting forward this strategy to integrate a new tolerance-inducing therapy for multiple sclerosis successfully.", "367": "To investigate the brain MRI features in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) and its clinical relevance in a large multi-center cohort in China.", "368": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) commonly complicated by cognitive impairment.

This meta-analysis investigated the effectiveness of different categories of drugs on the minimal assessment of cognitive function in MS (MACFIMS)-related tasks outcome in MS patients. To this end, a systematic evaluation was conducted using PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases. Among a total of 128 publications, 31 studies met our inclusion criteria, and 22 included in the meta-analysis. We found that symbol digit modalities test (SDMT), paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT), controlled oral word association test (COWAT), and California verbal learning test (CVLT) were the most frequently reported tasks in included studies. The frequently reported drugs were classified into five main groups of acetylcholine esterase inhibitors, CNS stimulants, fampridine, herbal remedies, and miscellaneous. Overall heterogeneity of the studies was modest. The treatments did not affect cognitive function in any of the tasks (p>0.05). However, in subgroup analysis, we found significant improvement in SDMT task outecomes after treatment by fampridine (0.283 SMD, 95%CI, 0.015 to 0.550, p\u202f=\u202f0.039, I2=11.7%).

A cohort of consecutive patients attended at a single Brazilian SSc outpatient clinic was analyzed regarding EF. Data were analyzed according to clinical, demographic and laboratory characteristics, as well as SSc subtype. In a cohort of 662 patients, 70 (10.6%) had known previous exposure to EF, predominantly organic solvents (51.4%), silica (20%), silicone (12.9%) and pesticides (11.4%). In the SSc cohort, patients with EF had a significantly higher frequency of male gender (p\u2009<\u20090.01), African-Brazilian ethnicity (p\u2009=\u20090.01), myopathy (p\u2009=\u20090.02), and pigmentary disorders (p\u2009=\u20090.04), with shorter disease duration (p\u2009=\u20090.01).

Two researchers selected words such as \"epidemiology\" or \"prevalence\" or \"incidence\" and \"suicidal ideation in multiple sclerosis\" and searched them as relevant keywords in international databases such as PubMed, Web of Science CINAHL, Embase, Psyc INFO, and Scopus. A point prevalence with 95% confidence interval was estimated. The variances of each study were calculated using the binomial distribution formula. Heterogeneity among the studies was tested by a Q-Cochran test with a significance level less than 0.1. Index of changes attributed to heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup>) was assessed. From among the 170 total articles found from 2011 to February 2019, we pooled and analyzed the data of eight final eligible studies, based on the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of suicidal ideation in multiple sclerosis patients was estimated as 13% (CI 95%\u00a0=\u00a00.09-0.17).

Female SJL/J mice were immunized with PLP<sub>139-151</sub> peptide to induce relapse-remitting EAE and the immunized mice were treated with vehicle alone (EAE) or ICA (12.5 or 25 mg/body weights) by gavage daily for 42 days. Compared with the control, the EAE mice developed relapse-remitting EAE and reduced body weights (15.76\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.61 vs. 17.60\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.98\u00a0g on day 13; 17.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.44 vs. 18.46\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.66\u00a0g on day 26), accompanied by severe inflammation with many microglia infiltrates and obvious demyelination in the spinal cord tissues.

Furthermore, ICA treatment significantly mitigated the EAE-increased iNOS, TNF-\u03b1, CD206 and TGF-\u03b21, but further reduced IL-10 mRNA transcripts in the brain mice. More importantly, ICA treatment significantly mitigated the inflammation-related NF-\u03baB, AKT, ERK1/2, p38, c-Jun and MEK phosphorylation in the brain of EAE mice. ICA treatment ameliorates the progression of EAE by down-regulating the major inflammation-related signal pathways in mice.", "374": "Despite the fact that the risk versus benefit of smoking cannabis has not been extensively studied, many individuals with multiple sclerosis are smoking cannabis to reduce their pain intensity and spasticity. The lack of information about inhaled cannabis might be attributed to the fact that most trials focus on orally administered cannabis. Given the fact that the administration of cannabis via inhalation is known to rapidly deliver cannabinoids with a higher total bioavailability than what can be achieved through oral or buccal routes, it is important to understand the clinical trials conducted using smoked cannabis on patients with multiple sclerosis.", "375": "Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is one of the main animal models used for the study of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Long-chain lipophilic amino alcohols with immunoregulatory activities have already been studied in some models of inflammatory diseases, but the action of these compounds in EAE and MS is still unknown. In this study, we investigated whether the lipophilic amino alcohol 4b would act to improve the clinical signs of EAE and reduce the demyelination process and the neuroinflammatory parameters in the spinal cord, as well as the inflammatory process in the inguinal lymph nodes, of C57Bl/6 mice induced with EAE after stimulation with MOG<sub>35-55</sub> and pertussis toxin. The 4b treatment (1.0\u00a0mg/kg/day) was orally administered, starting on the day of onset of clinical signs of the disease (10th) and ending on the 20th day after immunization. This treatment was able to reduce the cell count on the inguinal lymph nodes, the migration of inflammatory cells into the central nervous system (CNS), as well as the processes of microgliosis, astrogliosis, and the production of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines, thus increasing the IL-10 anti-inflammatory cytokine levels in EAE mice. The inhibition of Akt phosphorylation in the CNS of EAE mice after treatment with 4b indicates that the immunoregulatory action of 4b is related to the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Our results indicate the immunoregulatory efficacy of the new compound 4b in the control of some inflammatory parameters and in the glial proliferation. In addition, 4b was able to reduce the demyelination of neurons and the worsening of clinical signs of EAE as effectively as the compound FTY720, the first oral drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of MS.", "376": "Pyroptosis is a type of proinflammatory regulated cell death (RCD) in which caspase-1 proteolytically cleaves gasdermin D (GSDMD) to yield a cytotoxic pore-forming protein.

Briefly, C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into five groups. Group 1 received normal food and water during the study. Group 2 received cuprizone pellets for 5 weeks (demyelination phase) following one-week normal feeding during the remyelination phase. The remaining three groups received HCQ (2.5, 10 and 100\u00a0mg/kg) via drinking water during the demyelination phase. At the end of each phase, mice were deeply anesthetized, perfused with PBS through the heart, and their brains were removed. Brain sections stained with luxol fast blue and the images were analyzed. Also, the expression levels of miR-219 and miR-155-3p were evaluated by quantitative Real-Time PCR in all samples.\u00a0HCQ decreased the expression of miR-155-3p and increased miR-219 expression in animals treated with 100\u00a0mg/kg of HCQ compared to the control group (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and the cuprizone group (p\u2009<\u20090.0001).

Ubiquitination, a covalent posttranslational modification of target proteins with ubiquitin, has a profound effect on the stability and activity of its substrates, thereby regulating the immune system at molecular and cellular levels. Through the cooperative actions of E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases, ubiquitin modifications are implicated in several biological processes, including proteasomal degradation, transcriptional regulation, regulation of protein-protein interactions, endocytosis, autophagy, DNA repair, and cell cycle regulation. A20 (tumor necrosis factor \u03b1-induced protein 3 or TNFAIP3) is a ubiquitin-editing enzyme that mainly functions as an endogenous regulator of inflammation through termination of nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB activation as part of a negative feedback loop. A20 interacts with substrates that reside downstream of immune sensors, including Toll-like receptors, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing receptors, lymphocyte receptors, and cytokine receptors. Due to its pleiotropic functions as a ubiquitin binding protein, deubiquitinase and ubiquitin ligase, and its versatile role in various signaling pathways, aberrant A20 levels are associated with numerous conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, coronary artery disease, multiple sclerosis, cystic fibrosis, asthma, cancer, neurological disorders, and aging-related sequelae. Similarly, A20 has recently been implicated as an essential regulator of inflammation in the oral cavity. This review presents information on the ubiquitin system and regulation of NF-\u03baB by ubiquitination using A20 as a representative molecule and highlights how the dysregulation of this system can lead to several immune pathologies, including oral cavity-related disorders mainly focusing on periodontitis.", "397": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) often affects ambulation and the function of the lower limbs.

A large variety of NCR is expressed by central nervous system (CNS)-resident cell types and is associated with CNS homeostasis, interactions with peripheral immunity and CNS inflammation and disease. Immunotherapy blocking NCR affects the CNS as patients can develop neurological issues including encephalitis and multiple sclerosis (MS). How these treatments affect the CNS is incompletely understood, since expression and function of NCR in the CNS are only beginning to be unravelled. V-type immunoglobulin-like suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA) is an NCR that is expressed primarily in the haematopoietic system by myeloid and T cells. VISTA regulates T cell quiescence and activation and has a variety of functions in myeloid cells including efferocytosis, cytokine response and chemotaxis. In the CNS, VISTA is predominantly expressed by microglia and macrophages of the CNS. In this review, we summarize the role of NCR in the CNS during health and disease. We highlight expression of VISTA across cell types and CNS diseases and discuss the function of VISTA in microglia and during CNS ageing, inflammation and neurodegeneration. Understanding the role of VISTA and other NCR in the CNS is important considering the adverse effects of immunotherapy on the CNS, and in view of their therapeutic potential in CNS disease.", "399": "SARS-CoV2 infection is responsible for a complex clinical syndrome, named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), whose main consequences are severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Any disruption of iron homeostasis leads to either iron deficiency or iron overload, which can be detrimental for humans' health, especially in elderly. Each of these changes contributes to the faster development of many neurological disorders or stimulates progression of already present diseases. Age-related cellular and molecular alterations in iron metabolism can also lead to iron dyshomeostasis and deposition. Iron deposits can contribute to the development of inflammation, abnormal protein aggregation, and degeneration in the central nervous system (CNS), leading to the progressive decline in cognitive processes, contributing to pathophysiology of stroke and dysfunctions of body metabolism. Besides, since iron plays an important role in both neuroprotection and neurodegeneration, dietary iron homeostasis should be considered with caution. Recently, there has been increased interest in sex-related differences in iron metabolism and iron homeostasis. These differences have not yet been fully elucidated. In this review we will discuss the latest discoveries in iron metabolism, age-related changes, along with the sex differences in iron content in serum and brain, within the healthy aging population and in neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke.", "406": "Factors regulating self-antigen directed immune-responses in autoimmunity are poorly understood. Signal regulatory protein gamma (SIRP\u03b3) is a human T-cell specific protein with genetic variants associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D). SIRP\u03b3's function in the immune system remains unclear. We show that T1D and relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) subjects have significantly greater frequency of rs2281808 T genetic variant, that correlates with reduced SIRP\u03b3-expression in T-cells. Importantly, reduced SIRP\u03b3-expression in RRMS and T1D subjects was not restricted to T variant, suggesting SIRP\u03b3-expression is also regulated by disease specific factors in autoimmunity. Interestingly, increased frequencies of SIRP\u03b3low T-cells in RRMS and T1D positively correlated with proinflammatory molecules from T-cells. Finally, we show that SIRP\u03b3low T-cells have enhanced pathogenecity in vivo in a GVHD model.

A growing body of data are stressing that lithium seems to show broader properties, including neuroprotective effects. Lithium's ability to inhibit glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2, an enzyme that participates in the phosphorylation of \u03c4, a microtubule-associated protein, stimulated interest in its possible therapeutic role in Alzheimer disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Preliminary data also support exploration of lithium's potential therapeutic role in multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disorder that is associated with co-occurring mood disorders. Lithium is associated with teratogenic risks to the developing fetus; however, recently revised downward estimates of its teratogenic risk of causing fetal cardiac malformation suggest that its potential therapeutic benefit to both mothers with bipolar disorder and their offspring should be considered in at least some cases. A 43-year-old woman previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder and MS was treated with lithium and thyroid hormone supplementation as her sole medications during her pregnancy. The patient remained euthymic throughout her pregnancy and over the course of her 5-year follow-up evaluations on this medication regimen. In addition to her stable mood, there has been no symptomatic progression or relapse of her MS, and her daughter continues to develop normally.The case supports consideration of balancing lithium's mood-stabilizing benefit with its known teratogenic risk during pregnancy.

Nurse scientists have long recognized people with chronic conditions need effective self-management strategies across the lifespan, so they have led the way in establishing theoretical and practical grounds for the science of self-management. Guidance from pilot and feasibility research for self-management interventions is scarce. Documented exemplars of successes and failures in pilot and feasibility study designs are scant in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate methodological approaches using pilot and feasibility examples. To maximize collective lessons learned in self-management science study design, features of our pilot and feasibility research strategies that yielded both desirable and undesirable outcomes are described, analyzed, and paired with alternative solutions. A National Institute of Nursing Research P30 grant center, awarded grants to 8 pilot investigators to pilot self-management interventions. A wide variety of chronic conditions were addressed, including heart failure, chronic kidney disease, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and HIV. The investigators provided their experiences of study implementation. Common themes across the studies were identified. There were four lessons learned from these studies: 1) maximize resources and develop enough evidence for subsequent studies; 2) embed patient-centered feasibility within implementation testing with new patient populations; 3) develop a flexible participant recruitment plan to allow for adjustments when unexpected barriers arise; and 4) define study-specific data collection procedures to demonstrate feasibility.

Currently, it is estimated that 30-40% of the phenotypic variability of MS can be explained by genetic factors. However, low susceptibility variants identified through Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) were calculated to explain about 50% of the heritability. Whether familial high-risk variants also contribute to heritability is a subject of controversy. In the last few years, several familial variants have been nominated, but none of them have been unequivocally confirmed. One reason for this may be that genetic heterogeneity and reduced penetrance are hindering detection. Sequencing a large number of MS families is needed to answer this question. In this study, we performed whole exome sequencing in four multi-case families, of which at least three affected individuals per family were analyzed. We identified a total of 138 rare variants segregating with disease in each of the families. Although no single variant showed convincing evidence for disease causation, some genes seemed particularly interesting based on their biological function. The main aim of this study was to provide a complete list of all rare segregating variants to provide the possibility for other researchers to cross-check familial candidate genes in an unbiased manner.", "420": "We present the first public dataset with videos of oro-facial gestures performed by individuals with oro-facial impairment due to neurological disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and stroke.

Through extensive experiments with multiple facial landmark detection algorithms, including state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) models, we demonstrated the presence of bias in the landmark localization accuracy of pre-trained face alignment approaches in our participant groups. The pre-trained models produced higher errors in the two clinical groups compared to age-matched healthy control subjects. We also investigated how this bias changes when the existing models are fine-tuned using data from the target population.

The exact cascade of pathological processes (inflammation, demyelination, excitotoxicity, diffuse neuro-axonal degeneration, oxidative and metabolic stress, etc.) causing MS onset is still not fully understood, although several accompanying biomarkers are particularly suitable for the detection of early subclinical changes. Magnetic resonance (MR) methods are generally considered to be the most sensitive diagnostic tools. Their advantages include their noninvasive nature and their ability to image tissue in vivo. In particular, MR spectroscopy (proton <sup>1</sup>H and phosphorus <sup>31</sup>P MRS) is a powerful analytical tool for the detection and analysis of biomedically relevant metabolites, amino acids, and bioelements, and thus for providing information about neuro-axonal degradation, demyelination, reactive gliosis, mitochondrial and neurotransmitter failure, cellular energetic and membrane alternation, and the imbalance of magnesium homeostasis in specific tissues.

A single-group pre- and post-experimental study was conducted among 10 members of the Multiple Sclerosis Society of India between December 2017 and April 2018. At baseline and during follow-up, QOL, sleep quality, symptoms, and pain were assessed using the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, MS Symptom Checklist, and visual analogue scale, respectively. The intervention comprised 12 private customized yoga sessions of 1 hour duration and three group sessions, all spread over 3-months. Patient feedback and direct observations by the yoga therapist we re documented at each session. Ten patients (seven female, three male, age 31-52 years) were enrolled in the yoga intervention; seven completed 8-12 sessions, and three completed fewer than 5 sessions. Therapist-to-patient ratio was 1:2. All domains except sexual function showed clinically significant improvement in QOL scores. Statistically significant improvement was found in social function (p = 0.014) and change in health status (p = 0.029) scores after the intervention. Although there was improvement in pain and sleep quality, these changes were not statistically significant. Patients reported improvement in symptoms with practice of yoga alongside lifestyle changes. The study supports the feasibility of this 3-month yoga intervention for patients with MS.

The pathophysiologic mechanisms causing fatigue are still largely unknown. In 46 right-handed patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 25 right-handed controls, we performed diffusion MRI and applied streamline based probabilistic tractography to derive unilateral anatomical connectivity maps for the white matter of the right and left hemispheres. The maps provide an indication how often a streamline has passed through a given voxel. Since tractography based anatomical connectivity mapping (ACM) is sensitive to disease-induced changes in anatomical connectivity, we used ACM to test whether motor fatigue is associated with altered ipsi-hemispherical anatomical connectivity in the major motor output pathway, the corticospinal tract (CST). Patients had higher mean ACM values in the CST than healthy controls. This indicated that a higher number of streamlines, starting from voxels in the same hemisphere, travelled through the CST and may reflect an accumulated disease-induced disintegration of CST. The motor subscale of the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive functions (FSMC<sub>MOTOR</sub>) was used to define sub-groups with (n\u00a0=\u00a029, FSMC<sub>MOTOR</sub> score\u00a0\u2265\u00a027) and without motor fatigue (n\u00a0=\u00a017, FSMS<sub>MOTOR</sub> score\u00a0\u2264\u00a026). Patients without fatigue only showed higher ACM values in right CST, while mean ACM values were unaltered in left CST. The higher the mean ACM values in the left relative to the right CST, the more patients reported motor fatigue. Left-right asymmetry in anatomical connectivity outside the CST did not scale with individual motor fatigue.

However, a majority of candidate blood biomarkers for neurological damage that are studied today are proteins which were arbitrarily proposed several decades before the advent of high-throughput omic techniques, and it is unclear whether they represent the best possible targets relative to the remainder of the human proteome. Here, we leveraged mRNA expression data generated from nearly 12,000 human specimens to algorithmically evaluate over 17,000 protein-coding genes in terms of their potential to produce blood biomarkers for neurological damage based on their expression profiles both across the body and within the brain. The circulating levels of proteins associated with the top-ranked genes were then measured in blood sampled from a diverse cohort of patients diagnosed with a variety of acute and chronic neurological disorders, including ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis, and evaluated for their diagnostic performance. Our analysis identifies several previously unexplored candidate blood biomarkers of neurological damage with possible clinical utility, many of which whose presence in blood is likely linked to specific cell-level pathologic processes.

Here we used a microfluidic RT-qPCR screen to assess changes in the expression of the main endocannabinoid signaling genes in astrocytes and microglia purified from female mice during the time-course of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We show that astrocytes and microglia upregulate the expression of genes encoding neurotoxic A1 and pro-inflammatory molecules at the acute disease with many of these transcripts remaining elevated during the recovery phase. Both cell populations exhibited an early onset decrease in the gene expression levels of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) hydrolytic enzymes that persisted during EAE progression as well as cell-type-specific changes in the transcript levels for genes encoding cannabinoid receptors and molecules involved in anandamide (AEA) signaling.

Compounds with dual activity as NRF2 activators and BACH1 inhibitors, could therefore potentially provide a more robust antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, with an overall better neuroprotective outcome. The phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) inhibits BACH1 but lacks significant NRF2 activating properties. Based on this scaffold, we have developed a novel CBD derivative that is highly effective at both inhibiting BACH1 and activating NRF2. This new CBD derivative provides neuroprotection in cell models of relevance to Huntington's disease, setting the basis for further developments in vivo.", "449": "Cortical demyelinating lesions are clinically important in multiple sclerosis, but notoriously difficult to visualize with MRI. At clinical field strengths, double inversion recovery MRI is most sensitive, but still only detects 18% of all histopathologically validated cortical lesions. More recently, phase-sensitive inversion recovery was suggested to have a higher sensitivity than double inversion recovery, although this claim was not histopathologically validated. Therefore, this retrospective study aimed to provide clarity on this matter by identifying which MRI sequence best detects histopathologically-validated cortical lesions at clinical field strength, by comparing sensitivity and specificity of the thus far most commonly used MRI sequences, which are T2, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), double inversion recovery and phase-sensitive inversion recovery. Post-mortem MRI was performed on non-fixed coronal hemispheric brain slices of 23 patients with progressive multiple sclerosis directly after autopsy, at 3 T, using T1 and proton-density/T2-weighted, as well as FLAIR, double inversion recovery and phase-sensitive inversion recovery sequences. A total of 93 cortical tissue blocks were sampled from these slices. Blinded to histopathology, all MRI sequences were consensus scored for cortical lesions. Subsequently, tissue samples were stained for proteolipid protein (myelin) and scored for cortical lesion types I-IV (mixed grey matter/white matter, intracortical, subpial and cortex-spanning lesions, respectively). MRI scores were compared to histopathological scores to calculate sensitivity and specificity per sequence. Next, a retrospective (unblinded) scoring was performed to explore maximum scoring potential per sequence. Histopathologically, 224 cortical lesions were detected, of which the majority were subpial. In a mixed model, sensitivity of T1, proton-density/T2, FLAIR, double inversion recovery and phase-sensitive inversion recovery was 8.9%, 5.4%, 5.4%, 22.8% and 23.7%, respectively (20, 12, 12, 51 and 53 cortical lesions). Specificity of the prospective scoring was 80.0%, 75.0%, 80.0%, 91.1% and 88.3%. Sensitivity and specificity did not significantly differ between double inversion recovery and phase-sensitive inversion recovery, while phase-sensitive inversion recovery identified more lesions than double inversion recovery upon retrospective analysis (126 versus 95; P\u2009<\u20090.001). We conclude that, at 3 T, double inversion recovery and phase-sensitive inversion recovery sequences outperform conventional sequences T1, proton-density/T2 and FLAIR. While their overall sensitivity does not exceed 25%, double inversion recovery and phase-sensitive inversion recovery are highly pathologically specific when using existing scoring criteria and their use is recommended for optimal cortical lesion assessment in multiple sclerosis.", "450": "Recent studies have shown the ability of electrochemical methods to sense and determine, even at very low concentrations, the presence and quantity of molecules or analytes including pharmaceutical samples. Furthermore, analytical methods, such as high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), can also detect the presence and quantity of peptides at very low concentrations, in a simple, fast, and efficient way, which allows the monitoring of conjugation reactions and its completion. Graphite/SiO<sub>2</sub> film electrodes and HPLC methods were previously shown by our group to be efficient to detect drug molecules, such as losartan. We now use these methods to detect the conjugation efficiency of a peptide from the immunogenic region of myelin oligodendrocyte to a carrier, mannan. The HPLC method furthermore confirms the stability of the peptide with time in a simple one pot procedure. Our study provides a general method to monitor, sense and detect the presence of peptides by effectively confirming the conjugation efficiency. Such methods can be used when designing conjugates as potential immunotherapeutics in the treatment of diseases, including multiple sclerosis.", "451": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting the central nervous system (CNS) which can lead to severe disability. Several diseases can mimic the clinical manifestations of MS. This can often lead to a prolonged period that involves numerous tests and investigations before a definitive diagnosis is reached. As well as the possibility of misdiagnosis. Molecular biomarkers can play a unique role in this regard. Molecular biomarkers offer a unique view into the CNS disorders. They help us understand the pathophysiology of disease as well as guiding our diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic approaches in CNS disorders. This review highlights the most prominent molecular biomarkers found in the literature with respect to MS and its related disorders. Based on numerous recent clinical and experimental studies, we demonstrate that several molecular biomarkers could very well aid us in differentiating MS from its related disorders. The implications of this work will hopefully serve clinicians and researchers alike, who regularly deal with MS and its related disorders.", "452": "B cell depletion potently reduces episodes of inflammatory demyelination in multiple sclerosis (MS), predominantly through loss of innate rather than adaptive immunity. However, molecular mechanisms controlling innate versus adaptive B cell function are poorly understood. N-glycan branching, via interactions with galectins, controls endocytosis and signaling of cell surface receptors to control cell function. Here we report that N-glycan branching in B cells dose dependently reduces pro-inflammatory innate responses by titrating decreases in Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) and TLR2 surface expression via endocytosis. In contrast, a minimal level of N-glycan branching maximizes surface retention of the B cell receptor (BCR) and the CD19 co-receptor to promote adaptive immunity. Branched N-glycans inhibit antigen presentation by B cells to reduce T helper cell-17 (T<sub>H</sub>17)/T<sub>H</sub>1 differentiation and inflammatory demyelination in mice. Thus, N-glycan branching negatively regulates B cell innate function while promoting/maintaining adaptive immunity via BCR, providing an attractive therapeutic target for MS.", "453": "Disorders that disrupt myelin formation during development or in adulthood, such as multiple sclerosis and peripheral neuropathies, lead to severe pathologies, illustrating myelin's crucial role in normal neural functioning. However, although our understanding of glial biology is increasing, the signals that emanate from axons and regulate myelination remain largely unknown. To identify the core components of the myelination process, here we adopted a microarray analysis approach combined with laser-capture microdissection of spinal motoneurons during the myelinogenic phase of development. We identified neuronal genes whose expression was enriched during myelination and further investigated hepatoma-derived growth factor-related protein 3 (HRP3 or HDGFRP3). HRP3 was strongly expressed in the white matter fiber tracts of the peripheral (PNS) and central (CNS) nervous systems during myelination and remyelination in a cuprizone-induced demyelination model. The dynamic localization of HPR3 between axons and nuclei during myelination was consistent with its axonal localization during neuritogenesis. To study this phenomenon, we identified two splice variants encoded by the <i>HRP3</i> gene: the canonical isoform HRP3-I and a newly recognized isoform, HRP3-II. HRP3-I remained solely in the nucleus, whereas HRP3-II displayed distinct axonal localization both before and during myelination. Interestingly, HRP3-II remained in the nuclei of unmyelinated neurons and glial cells, suggesting the existence of a molecular machinery that transfers it to and retains it in the axons of neurons fated for myelination. Overexpression of HRP3-II, but not of HRP3-I, increased Schwann cell numbers and myelination in PNS neuron-glia co-cultures. However, HRP3-II overexpression in CNS co-cultures did not alter myelination.", "454": "To develop a fast and accurate convolutional neural network based method for segmentation of thalamic nuclei.", "455": "People with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) experience a wide range of disabilities which negatively impact their quality of life (QOL).

Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) have the potential to repair demyelinated tissue because they can both self-renew and differentiate into oligodendrocytes (OLs), the myelin producing cells of the central nervous system (CNS). Cell-matrix interactions impact OPC differentiation into OLs, but the process is not fully understood. Biomaterial hydrogel systems help to elucidate cell-matrix interactions because they can mimic specific properties of native CNS tissue in an in vitro setting. We investigated whether OPC maturation into OLs is influenced by interacting with a urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) degradable extracellular matrix (ECM). uPA is a proteolytic enzyme that is transiently upregulated in the developing rat brain, with peak uPA expression correlating with an increase in myelin production in vivo. OPC-like cells isolated through the Mosaic Analysis with Double Marker technique (MADM OPCs) produced low molecular weight uPA in culture. MADM OPCs were encapsulated into two otherwise similar elastin-like protein (ELP) hydrogel systems: one that was uPA degradable and one that was non-degradable. Encapsulated MADM OPCs had similar viability, proliferation, and metabolic activity in uPA degradable and non-degradable ELP hydrogels. Expression of OPC maturation-associated genes, however, indicated that uPA degradable ELP hydrogels promoted MADM OPC maturation although not sufficiently for these cells to differentiate into OLs.", "460": "Clinical registers constitute an invaluable resource in the medical data-driven decision making context. Accurate machine learning and data mining approaches on these data can lead to faster diagnosis, definition of tailored interventions, and improved outcome prediction.

In this work, we propose an imputation algorithm based on a mutual information-weighted k-nearest neighbours approach, able to handle the simultaneous presence of missing information in different types of variables.

It acts at a multitude of ligand-gated cationic channels termed P2X to induce rapid depolarization of the cell membrane. Within this receptor-channel family, the P2X7 receptor (R) allows the transmembrane fluxes of Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and K<sup>+</sup>, but also allows the slow permeation of larger organic molecules. This is supposed to cause necrosis by excessive Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, as well as depletion of intracellular ions and metabolites. Cell death may also occur by apoptosis due to the activation of the caspase enzymatic cascade. Because P2X7Rs are localized in the CNS preferentially on microglia, but also at a lower density on neuroglia (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes) the stimulation of this receptor leads to the release of neurodegeneration-inducing bioactive molecules such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, proteases, reactive oxygen and nitrogen molecules, and the excitotoxic glutamate/ATP. Various neurodegenerative reactions of the brain/spinal cord following acute harmful events (mechanical CNS damage, ischemia, status epilepticus) or chronic neurodegenerative diseases (neuropathic pain, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) lead to a massive release of ATP via the leaky plasma membrane of neural tissue. This causes cellular damage superimposed on the original consequences of neurodegeneration. Hence, blood-brain-barrier permeable pharmacological antagonists of P2X7Rs with excellent bioavailability are possible therapeutic agents for these diseases. The aim of this review article is to summarize our present state of knowledge on the involvement of P2X7R-mediated events in neurodegenerative illnesses endangering especially the life quality and duration of the aged human population.", "467": "Bile acids are commonly known as digestive agents for lipids.

Recent studies have shown that bile acid signaling may also have a prevalent role in the central nervous system. Some bile acids, such as tauroursodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid, have shown neuroprotective potential in experimental animal models and clinical studies of many neurological conditions. Alterations in bile acid metabolism have been discovered as potential biomarkers for prognosis tools as well as the expression of various bile acid receptors in multiple neurological ailments.

In the central nervous system (CNS), pericytes are important contributors to the structure and function of the neurovascular unit, which includes endothelial cells, astrocytes and neurons. The understanding of pericytes has been marred by an inability to accurately distinguish pericytes from other stromal cells with similar expression of identifying markers. Evidence is now growing in favor of pericytes being actively involved in both CNS homeostasis and pathology of neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and Alzheimer's disease among others. In this review, we discuss the current understanding on the characterization of pericytes, their roles in maintaining the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, and their contributions to neuroinflammation and neurorepair. Owing to its plethora of surface receptors, pericytes respond to inflammatory mediators such as CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, in turn secreting CCL2, nitric oxide, and several cytokines. Pericytes can therefore act as promoters of both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. Much like professional phagocytes, pericytes also have the ability to clear up cellular debris and macromolecular plaques. Moreover, pericytes promote the activities of CNS glia, including in maturation of oligodendrocyte lineage cells for myelination. Conversely, pericytes can impair regenerative processes by contributing to scar formation. A better characterization of CNS pericytes and their functions would bode well for therapeutics aimed at alleviating their undesirable properties and enhancing their benefits.", "469": "The incidence of neuropathy with checkpoint inhibitors is 0.3-1%, typically occurring 2-12\u2009weeks after treatment initiation.

Chronic and dysregulated microglial cell activation has increasingly been linked to the status of neuroinflammation underlying many neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the stimulus (or stimuli) and mechanisms by which microglial activation is initiated and maintained MS are still debated. The purpose of our research was to investigate whether the endogenous mitochondrial (mt)-derived damage-associated molecular patterns (MTDs) mtDNA, N-formyl peptides and cardiolipin (CL) contribute to these phenomena. We characterized the effects of the abovementioned MTDs on microglia activation in vitro (i.e. using HMC3 cells) by evaluating the expression of gene coding for proteins involved in their binding and coupled to downstream signaling pathways, the up-regulation of markers of activation on the cell surface and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species. At the transcriptional level, significant variations in the mRNA relative expression of five of eleven selected genes were observed in response to stimulation. No changes in activation of antigenic profile or functional properties of HMC3 cells were observed; there was no up-regulation of HLA-DR expression or increased secretion of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-6. However, after stimulation with mtDNA and CL, an increase in cellular oxidative stress, but not in the mt ROS O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, compared to control cells, were observed. There were no effects on cell viability. Overall, our data suggest that MTDs could cause a failure in microglial activation toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype, possibly triggering an endogenous regulatory mechanism for the resolution of neuroinflammation. This could open a door for the development of drugs selectively targeting microglia and modulating its functionality to treat MS and/or other neurodegenerative conditions in which MTDs have a pathogenic relevance.", "471": "The emergence of novel Coronavirus 2019 and the subsequent pandemic are presenting a challenge to neurologists managing patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).

IL-6 may have multiple roles in NMOSD pathophysiology by promoting plasmablast survival, stimulating the production of antibodies against aquaporin-4, disrupting blood-brain barrier integrity and functionality, and enhancing proinflammatory T-lymphocyte differentiation and activation. Case series have shown decreased relapse rates following IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) blockade in patients with NMOSD, and 2 recent phase 3 randomized controlled trials confirmed that IL-6R inhibition reduces the risk of relapses in NMOSD.

GSDMD succination prevents its interaction with caspases, limiting its processing, oligomerization, and capacity to induce cell death. In mice, the administration of DMF protects against LPS shock and alleviates familial Mediterranean fever and experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) by targeting GSDMD.

The determination of the CSF total protein (TP) content represents an important screening test of various pathologies. We aimed to address the effect of sex and age on CSF TP content and the use of the current upper reference limits (URLs). Methods CSF TP content was analysed in a selected population of 1,252 patients (648 women and 604 men; age 18-89 years) who underwent lumbar puncture as a part of the diagnostic work-up. Samples presenting (i) more than 5 white blood cells (WBC)/\u00b5L, (ii) discolorations and (iii) reduced glucose were not included. Results The CSF TP content\u200b\u200b median values were significantly higher in men than in women (46 vs. 37\u00a0mg/dL) even after adjusting for age and different hospital inpatients. CSF TP content positively correlated with age both in men and in women with a constant difference between sexes of 8.5\u00a0mg/dL. Applying the most used URLs (mainly 45 and 50\u00a0mg/dL, but also 60\u00a0mg/dL), men received a laboratory report suggestive of altered CSF TP content more frequently than women. The use of age- and sex-calibrated CSF TP URLs reduced, but not eliminated, this sex-gap. Conclusions Using the current URLs, a condition of \"elevated CSF TP content\" may be overestimated in men or, conversely, underestimated in women, regardless of the age and of the diagnosis. These results highlighted the need to apply CSF TP URLs values \u200b\u200bnormalized for both sex and age.", "478": "B cells have increasingly come under the spotlight as mediators of inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS).

Despite the availability of immunomodulatory therapies effective to reduce relapse rate and slow disease progression, they all failed to restore CNS myelin that is necessary for MS full recovery. Microglia are the primary inflammatory cells present in MS lesions, therefore strongly contributing to demyelination and lesion extension. Thus, many microglial-based therapeutic strategies have been focused on the suppression of microglial pro-inflammatory phenotype and neurodegenerative state to reduce disease severity. On the other hand, the contribution of myelin phagocytosis advocating the neuroprotective role of microglia in MS has been less explored. Indeed, despite the presence of functional oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), within lesioned areas, MS plaques fail to remyelinate as a result of the over-accumulation of myelin-toxic debris that must be cleared away by microglia. Dysregulation of this process has been associated with the impaired neuronal recovery and deficient remyelination. In line with this, here we provide a comprehensive review of microglial myelin phagocytosis and its involvement in MS development and repair. Alongside, we discuss the potential of phagocytic-mediated therapeutic approaches and encourage their modulation as a novel and rational approach to ameliorate MS-associated pathology.", "480": "Metformin, a synthetic derivative of guanidine, is commonly used as an oral antidiabetic agent and is considered a multi-vector application agent in the treatment of other inflammatory diseases.

Although the pathophysiology of MS remains unknown, it is most likely a combination of disturbances of the immune system and biochemical pathways with a disruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB), and it is strictly related to injury of intracerebral blood vessels. Metformin has properties which are greatly desirable for MS therapy, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory or antiplatelet functions. The latest reports relating to the cardiovascular disease confirm an increased risk of ischemic events in MS patients, which are directly associated with a coagulation cascade and an elevated pro-thrombotic platelet function.

Accumulating evidence suggests that a common pathologic cascade across multiple organs and additional organ-specific pathologies underpin SSc development. The common pathologic cascade starts with vascular injury due to autoimmune attacks and unknown environmental factors. After that, dysregulated angiogenesis and defective vasculogenesis promote vascular structural abnormalities, such as capillary loss and arteriolar stenosis, while aberrantly activated endothelial cells facilitate the infiltration of circulating immune cells into perivascular areas of various organs. Arteriolar stenosis directly causes pulmonary arterial hypertension, scleroderma renal crisis and digital ulcers. Chronic inflammation persistently activates interstitial fibroblasts, leading to the irreversible fibrosis of multiple organs. The common pathologic cascade interacts with a variety of modifying factors in each organ, such as keratinocytes and adipocytes in the skin, esophageal stratified squamous epithelia and myenteric nerve system in gastrointestinal tract, vasospasm of arterioles in the heart and kidney, and microaspiration of gastric content in the lung.

Sinomenine is a natural alkaloid with different therapeutic benefits, including anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities. In this study, possible beneficial effects of sinomenine in an MOG-induced model of MS were determined. Sinomenine was given to MOG<sub>35-55</sub>-immunized C57BL/6 mice at doses of 25 or 100\u00a0mg/kg/day after onset of MS clinical signs till day 30 post-immunization. Analyzed data showed that sinomenine reduces severity of the clinical signs and to some extent decreases tissue level of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-18, TNF\u03b1, IL-17A, and increases level of anti-inflammatory IL-10. In addition, sinomenine successfully attenuated tissue levels of inflammasome NLRP3, ASC, and caspase 1 besides its reduction of intensity of neuroinflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage and loss in lumbar spinal cord specimens. Furthermore, immunoreactivity for MBP decreased and increased for GFAP and Iba1 after MOG-immunization, which was in part reversed upon sinomenine administration. Overall, sinomenine decreases EAE severity, which is attributed to its alleviation of microglial and astrocytic mobilization, demyelination, and axonal damage along with its suppression of neuroinflammation, and its beneficial effect is also associated with its inhibitory effects on inflammasome and pyroptotic pathways; this may be of potential benefit for the primary progressive phenotype of MS.", "484": "Individuals with pre-existing chronic illness have shown increased anxiety and depression due to COVID-19.

Motivated by a randomized controlled trial in pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS), a continuous monitoring procedure for overdispersed count data was proposed recently. However, this procedure assumed constant event rates, an assumption often not met in practice. Here we extend the procedure to accommodate time trends in the event rates considering two blinded approaches: (a) the mixture approach modeling the number of events by a mixture of two negative binomial distributions and (b) the lumping approach approximating the marginal distribution of the event counts by a negative binomial distribution. Through simulations the operating characteristics of the proposed procedures are investigated under decreasing event rates. We find that the type I error rate is not inflated relevantly by either of the monitoring procedures, with the exception of strong time dependencies where the procedure assuming constant rates exhibits some inflation. Furthermore, the procedure accommodating time trends has generally favorable power properties compared with the procedure based on constant rates which stops often too late.

Kombucha is produced by the fermentation of sugared tea with a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeasts. This research was designed to reveal the therapeutic impact and the molecular and cellular processes determining the effect of kombucha on MS alleviation in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The EAE was induced using myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG<sub>35-55</sub>) peptide emulsified in CFA and injected subcutaneously over two flank areas in C57BL/6 mice. In addition, pertussis toxin was injected intraperitoneally and repeated 48\u00a0h later. Treatment groups were received three different doses of kombucha (K1: low dose, K2: medium dose and K3: high dose) to obtain a maximum protection. Clinical scores and other criteria were followed daily for the 25\u00a0days. At the end of the course, T-helper-related cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, IL-17, IL-4, and TGF-\u03b2) were measured through ELISA.

We sought to investigate the effect of age on relapse recovery. We identified patients with multiple sclerosis from two longitudinal prospective studies, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score within 30 days after onset of an attack, and follow-up EDSS 6 months after attack. Adult patients with multiple sclerosis (n\u2009=\u2009632) were identified from the Comprehensive Longitudinal Investigations in Multiple Sclerosis at Brigham study (CLIMB), and paediatric patients (n\u2009=\u2009132) from the US Network of Paediatric Multiple Sclerosis Centers (NPMSC) registry. Change in EDSS was defined as the difference in EDSS between attack and follow-up. Change in EDSS at follow-up compared to baseline was significantly lower in children compared to adults (P\u2009=\u20090.001), as were several functional system scores. Stratification by decade at onset for change in EDSS versus age found for every 10 years of age, EDSS recovery is reduced by 0.15 points (P\u2009<\u20090.0001). A larger proportion of children versus adults demonstrated improvement in EDSS following an attack (P\u2009=\u20090.006). For every 10 years of age, odds of EDSS not improving increase by 1.33 times (P\u2009<\u20090.0001). Younger age is associated with improved recovery from relapses.

Fractalkine receptor-deficient mice exhibit a reduction in microglial engulfment of viable OPCs, increased numbers of oligodendrocytes, and reduced myelin thickness but no change in axon number. These data provide evidence that microglia phagocytose OPCs as a homeostatic mechanism for proper myelination. A hallmark of hypomyelinating developmental disorders such as periventricular leukomalacia and of adult demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis is increased numbers of oligodendrocytes but failure to myelinate, suggesting that microglial pruning of OPCs may be impaired in pathological states and hinder myelination.", "496": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune disease. It is due to the interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Current opinion is that diet could play a pathogenic role in disease onset and development. Dietary restriction (DR) without malnutrition markedly improves health and increases lifespan in multiple model organisms. DR regimens that utilize continuous or intermittent food restriction can induce anti-inflammatory, immuno-modulatory and neuroendocrine adaptations promoting health. These adaptations exert neuroprotective effects in the main MS animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). This review summarizes the current knowledge on DR-induced changes in gut microbial composition and metabolite production and its impact on underlying functional mechanisms.

Among the several therapeutic options developed over the last decade for relapsing MS (RMS), fingolimod, a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) modulator, was the first oral treatment. The adverse events associated with fingolimod have limited its use in certain populations, thus further stimulating the search for other S1PR modulators.", "498": "Sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor-1 (S1P<sub>1</sub> ) activation maintains endothelial barrier integrity, whereas S1P<sub>1</sub> desensitization induces peripheral blood lymphopenia. The latter is exploited in the approval and/or late-stage development of receptor-desensitizing agents targeting the S1P<sub>1</sub> receptor in multiple sclerosis, such as siponimod, ozanimod, and ponesimod. SAR247799 is a recently described G protein-biased S1P<sub>1</sub> agonist that activates S1P<sub>1</sub> without desensitization and thus has endothelial-protective properties in patients without reducing lymphocytes. As SAR247799 demonstrated endothelial-protective effects at sub-lymphocyte-reducing doses, the possibility exists that other S1P<sub>1</sub> modulators could also exhibit endothelial-protective properties at lower doses. To explore this possibility, we sought to quantitatively compare the biased properties of SAR247799 with the most advanced clinical molecules targeting S1P<sub>1</sub> . In this study, we define the \u03b2-arrestin pathway component of the impedance profile following S1P<sub>1</sub> activation in a human umbilical vein endothelial cell line (HUVEC) and report quantitative indices of the S1P<sub>1</sub> activation-to-desensitization ratio of various clinical molecules. In a label-free impedance assay assessing endothelial barrier integrity and disruption, the mean estimates (95% confidence interval) of the activation-to-desensitization ratios of SAR247799, ponesimod, ozanimod, and siponimod were 114 (91.1-143), 7.66 (3.41-17.2), 6.35 (3.21-12.5), and 0.170 (0.0523-0.555), respectively. Thus, we show that SAR247799 is the most G protein-biased S1P<sub>1</sub> agonist currently characterized.

It is involved in TCR signalling events driving processes like T cell development as well as Th2, Th9 and Th17 responses thereby controlling the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Studies have shown that ITK is involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases as well as in carcinogenesis. The loss of ITK or its activity either by mutation or by the use of inhibitors led to a beneficial outcome in experimental models of asthma, inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis among others. In humans, biallelic mutations in the ITK gene locus result in a monogenetic disorder leading to T cell dysfunction; in consequence, mainly EBV infections can lead to severe immune dysregulation evident by lymphoproliferation, lymphoma and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Furthermore, patients who suffer from angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma have been found to express significantly more ITK. These findings put ITK in the strong focus as a target for drug development.", "500": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), the etiology of which is poorly understood. The most common laboratory abnormality associated with MS is increased intrathecal immunoglobulin G (IgG) synthesis and the presence of oligoclonal bands (OCBs) in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, the major antigenic targets of these antibody responses are unknown. The risk of MS is increased after infectious mononucleosis (IM) due to EBV infection, and MS patients have higher serum titers of anti-EBV antibodies than control populations. Our goal was to identify disease-relevant epitopes of IgG antibodies in MS; to do so, we screened phage-displayed random peptide libraries (12-mer) with total IgG antibodies purified from the brain of a patient with acute MS. We identified and characterized the phage peptides for binding specificity to intrathecal IgG from patients with MS and from controls by ELISA, phage-mediated Immuno-PCR, and isoelectric focusing. We identified two phage peptides that share sequence homologies with EBV nuclear antigens 1 and 2 (EBNA1 and EBNA2), respectively. The specificity of the EBV epitopes found by panning with MS brain IgG was confirmed by ELISA and competitive inhibition assays. Using a highly sensitive phage-mediated immuno-PCR assay, we determined specific bindings of the two EBV epitopes to IgG from CSF from 46 MS and 5 inflammatory control (IC) patients. MS CSF IgG have significantly higher bindings to EBNA1 epitope than to EBNA2 epitope, whereas EBNA1 and EBNA2 did not significantly differ in binding to IC CSF IgG. Further, the EBNA1 epitope was recognized by OCBs from multiple MS CSF as shown in blotting assays with samples separated by isoelectric focusing. The EBNA1 epitope is reactive to MS intrathecal antibodies corresponding to oligoclonal bands. This reinforces the potential role of EBV in the etiology of MS. Graphical abstract Antibodies purified from an MS brain plaque were panned by phage display peptide libraries to discern potential antigens. Phage displaying peptide sequences resembling Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens 1 & 2 (EBNA1 & 2) epitopes were identified.

Changes in different parts of the mTOR signaling pathway are among the potential suggested mechanisms based on the specific roles of this pathway in CNS. MTOR, RPS6KB1, and EIFEBP1 genes are among important genes in the mTOR pathway, responsible for the proper function of acting proteins in this signaling pathway. This study aimed to investigate the relative expression levels of these genes in the blood samples of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients compared to healthy controls. In this case-control study blood samples were collected from 30 newly diagnosed RRMS patients and 30 age and sex-matched healthy controls. mRNA level of MTOR, RPS6KB1, and EIFEBP1 genes were assessed using Real-Time PCR. The expression of MTOR, RPS6KB1, and EIF4EBP1 genes was up regulated in MS patients compared to healthy controls (p\u2009<\u20090.001 for all mentioned genes). Considering gender differences, expression of the mentioned genes was increased among female patients (all P\u2009<\u20090.001). However, no statistically significant changes were observed among male patients. Based on the receiver operating characteristic, MTOR gene had the highest diagnostic value followed by EIF4EBP1 and RPS6KB1 genes in differentiating RRMS patients from controls. In conclusion, we found the simultaneous upregulation of MTOR, RPS6KB1, and EIF4EBP1 genes among RRMS patients. MTOR showed to have the highest diagnostic value compared to other 2 genes in differentiating RRMS patients.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has been associated with several disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), including DMF in treating MS. We present detailed clinical characteristics of nine PML cases and show that the PML incidence in DMF-treated patients is 0.02 per 1000 patients. In addition to persistent severe lymphopenia, older age appears to be a potential risk for PML. However, younger patients without lymphopenia were also observed to develop PML. DMF-associated PML has occurred in patients with absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) above the guideline threshold, suggesting that changes in specific subsets might be more important than total ALC. Furthermore, since DMF has been found to decrease immune cell migration by decreasing the expression of adhesive molecules, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) immune profile may also be useful for assessing PML risk in DMF-treated patients. This review provides an up-to-date assessment of PML cases occurring in DMF-treated patients and discusses other potential considerations in light of our current understanding of DMF's mechanism of action on the immune system in the periphery and in the central nervous system (CNS).", "505": "T lymphocyte motility and interaction dynamics with other immune cells are vital determinants of immune responses. Regulatory T (Treg) cells prevent autoimmune disorders by suppressing excessive lymphocyte activity, but how interstitial motility patterns of Treg cells limit neuroinflammation is not well understood. We used two-photon microscopy to elucidate the spatial organization, motility characteristics, and interactions of endogenous Treg and Th17 cells together with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) within the spinal cord leptomeninges in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis. Th17 cells arrive before the onset of clinical symptoms, distribute uniformly during the peak, and decline in numbers during later stages of EAE. In contrast, Treg cells arrive after Th17 cells and persist during the chronic phase. Th17 cells meander widely, interact with APCs, and exhibit cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and elevated basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels before the arrival of Treg cells. In contrast, Treg cells adopt a confined, repetitive-scanning motility while contacting APCs. These locally confined but highly motile Treg cells limit Th17 cells from accessing APCs and suppress Th17 cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling by a mechanism that is upstream of store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. Finally, Treg cell depletion increases APC numbers in the spinal cord and exaggerates ongoing neuroinflammation. Our results point to fundamental differences in motility characteristics between Th17 and Treg cells in the inflamed spinal cord and reveal three potential cellular mechanisms by which Treg cells regulate Th17 cell effector functions: reduction of APC density, limiting access of Th17 cells to APCs, and suppression of Th17 Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.", "506": "Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an uncommon antibody-mediated disease of the central nervous system.

Unlike multiple sclerosis, a progressive clinical course is very unusual and the accrual of disability is related to relapses. Aggressive treatment of attacks and highly efficient maintenance therapies to prevent attacks are therefore crucial to prevent residual disability. In this article, we review how high dose steroids and most importantly apheresis and modern therapies implicating B cell depletion, inhibition of complement and IL-6 reception are effective to change its natural history.

Little is known about the effect of fingolimod on ICI cancer therapy, as fingolimod may limit the number of TILs. Here we present three patients with RRMS, who developed various cancers during fingolimod treatment. Histology of all tumors consistently showed low numbers of TILs. A second biopsy taken from one of the tumors, a melanoma, revealed a significant increase of TILs after stopping fingolimod and starting pembrolizumab, indicating a surge in the\u00a0number and re-invigoration of T cells.

In this study, to elucidate the impact of relapses to the progression of accumulated neurological disability and to identify the factors to affect the progression of neurological disability in MS and NMOSD, we followed 62 consecutive MS patients and 33 consecutive NMOSD patients for more than 5\u00a0years with the clinical symptoms, relapse occurrence, and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) in the chronic phase. All enrolled MS patients were confirmed to be negative for serum anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody. As a result, patients with NMOSD showed significantly severer neurological disability at 5\u00a0years from onset than MS patients. Progression in EDSS score was almost exclusively seen after clinical attacks in NMOSD, whereas progression could be observed apart from relapses in MS. Neurological disability did not change without attacks in NMOSD, whereas it sometimes spontaneously improved or deteriorated apart from relapses in MS (p\u2009<\u20090.001). In patients with MS, those with responsible lesions primarily in spinal cord were more likely to show such spontaneous improvement. In conclusion, clinical deterioration in NMOSD patients is irreversible and almost exclusively takes place at the timing of clinical attacks with stepwise accumulation of neurological disability.

Given the emerging role of B cells as APCs in these diseases, in this study, we addressed whether and how <i>CLEC16A</i> is involved in the BCR-dependent HLA-II pathway. <i>CLEC16A</i> was coexpressed with surface class II-associated invariant chain peptides (CLIP) in human EBV-positive and not EBV-negative B cell lines. Stable knockdown of <i>CLEC16A</i> in EBV-positive Raji B cells resulted in an upregulation of surface HLA-DR and CD74 (invariant chain), whereas CLIP was slightly but significantly reduced. In addition, IgM-mediated <i>Salmonella</i> uptake was decreased, and MIICs were less clustered in <i>CLEC16A</i>-silenced Raji cells, implying that <i>CLEC16A</i> controls both HLA-DR/CD74 and BCR/Ag processing in MIICs. In primary B cells, <i>CLEC16A</i> was only induced under CLIP-stimulating conditions in vitro and was predominantly expressed in CLIP<sup>high</sup> naive populations. Finally, CLIP-loaded HLA-DR molecules were abnormally enriched, and coregulation with <i>CLEC16A</i> was abolished in blood B cells of patients who rapidly develop MS. These findings demonstrate that CLEC16A participates in the BCR-dependent HLA-II pathway in human B cells and that this regulation is impaired during MS disease onset. The abundance of CLIP already on naive B cells of MS patients may point to a chronically induced stage and a new mechanism underlying B cell-mediated autoimmune diseases such as MS.", "521": "To evaluate the serum cytokine profiles in patients with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoproteins antibody associated disease (MOGAD), compared to those in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder with aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G (APQ4-IgG+\u00a0NMOSD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and other inflammatory demyelinating diseases (IDDs).", "522": "To identify the mechanisms relevant for the therapeutic effect of glatiramer acetate (GA), we studied T- and B- regulatory cells as well as GM-CSF expression in mice recovered from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).

The prevalence of Bregs in the periphery and the CNS of EAE-mice increased following GA-treatment. Furthermore, GA downregulated the pathological expression of GM-CSF, on both the protein and mRNA levels.

Here, we aimed to evaluate the short-term risk of disease activity in a 1-year prospective follow-up of the same patient cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a040). We found that all patients available for follow-up after one year (n\u00a0=\u00a035) fulfilled the criteria for no evidence of disease activity (NEDA).

Although this process was extensively described in acute CNS damages, novel evidence indicates the involvement of a fibrotic reaction in chronic CNS injuries as those occurring during neurodegenerative diseases, where inflammation and fibrosis fuel degeneration. In this mini review, we discuss recent advances around the role of fibrotic scar formation and function in different neurodegenerative conditions, particularly focusing on the rising role of scarring in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease and highlighting the therapeutic relevance of targeting fibrotic scarring to slow and reverse neurodegeneration.", "530": "<b>Background:</b> Mobility impairment is common in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) and can be assessed with clinical tests and surveys that have restricted ecological validity. Commercial research-based accelerometers are considered to be more valuable as they measure real-life mobility. Smartphone accelerometry might be an easily accessible alternative. <b>Objective:</b> To explore smartphone accelerometry in comparison to clinical tests, surveys, and a wrist-worn ActiGraph in pwMS and controls. <b>Methods:</b> Sixty-seven pwMS and 70 matched controls underwent mobility tests and surveys. Real-life data were collected with a smartphone and an ActiGraph over 7 days. We explored different smartphone metrics in a technical validation course and computed afterward correlation between ActiGraph (steps per minute), smartphone accelerometry (variance of vector magnitude), clinical tests, and surveys. We also determined the ability to separate between patients and controls as well as between different disability groups. <b>Results:</b> Based on the technical validation, we found the variance of the vector magnitude as a reliable estimate to discriminate wear time and no wear-time of the smartphone. Due to a further association with different activity levels, it was selected for real-life analyses. In the cross-sectional study, ActiGraph correlated moderately (<i>r</i> = 0.43, <i>p</i> < 0.05) with the smartphone but less with clinical tests (rho between |0.211| and |0.337|). Smartphone data showed stronger correlations with age (rho = -0.487) and clinical tests (rho between |0.565| and |0.605|).

We aimed to investigate the association between low carbohydrate diet (LCD) and NMOSD odds. <i>Method</i>: Seventy NMOSD patients with definite diagnosis and 164 hospital-based controls were enrolled in this case-control study. Dietary data was obtained using a validated 168-item food frequency questionnaire. To determine the LCD score, participants were stratified into 11 groups according to carbohydrate, protein, fat, animal fat, animal protein, vegetable fat and vegetable protein intakes. Higher intake of protein and fat, and lower intake of carbohydrate received a higher score between 0-10. Macronutrients scores were summed together and LCD scores calculated. The association between LCD scores and likelihood of being assigned to NMOSD group was investigated using multiple regression models. <i>Results</i>: Total LCD scores increased from the median of 21.00 in the first decile to 53.00 in the tenth decile of LCD score. After adjustment for confounding factors including age, gender, BMI, energy intake, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption, an inverse association was detected between LCD scores and odds of NMOSD.

Our goals in the present study were to (1) establish a method that removes scanner effects by leveraging multiple scans collected on the same subject, and, building on this, (2) develop a technique to quantify scanner effects in large multisite studies so these can be reduced as a preprocessing step. We illustrate scanner effects in a brain MRI study in which the same subject was measured twice on seven scanners, and assess our method's performance in a second study in which ten subjects were scanned on two machines. We found that unharmonized images were highly variable across site and scanner type, and our method effectively removed this variability by aligning intensity distributions.

This study sets out to evaluate the production of lovastatin by Brazilian wild strains of <i>A. terreus</i> isolated from a biological sample and natural sources. Carbon and nitrogen sources and the best physicochemical conditions using factorial design were also evaluated. The 37 fungal were grown to produce lovastatin by submerged fermentation. <i>A. terreus</i> URM5579 strain was the best lovastatin producer with a level of 13.96\u2009mg/L. Soluble starch and soybean flour were found to be the most suitable substrates for producing lovastatin (41.23\u2009mg/L) and biomass (6.1\u2009mg/mL).

These cells integrate complex molecular signals and undergo comprehensive phenotypical remodeling to adapt inflammatory responses. In the last years, single-cell analyses have revealed that microglia exhibit diverse phenotypes during development, growth and disease. Emerging evidence suggests that such phenotype transitions are mediated by reprogramming of cell metabolism. Indeed, metabolic pathways are distinctively altered in activated microglia and are central nodes controlling microglial responses. Microglial lipid metabolism has been specifically involved in the control of microglial activation and effector functions, such as migration, phagocytosis and inflammatory signaling, and minor disturbances in microglial lipid handling associates with altered brain function in disorders featuring neuroinflammation. In this review, we explore new and relevant aspects of microglial metabolism in health and disease. We give special focus on how different branches of lipid metabolism, such as lipid sensing, synthesis and oxidation, integrate and control essential aspects of microglial biology, and how disturbances in these processes associate with aging and the pathogenesis of, for instance, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.

PML principally affects people with a compromised immune system, such as patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) receiving treatment with natalizumab. However, intrathecal synthesis of lipid-reactive IgM in MS patients is associated with a markedly lower incidence of natalizumab-associated PML compared to those without this antibody repertoire. Here we demonstrate that a subset of lipid-reactive human and murine IgMs induce a functional anti-viral response that inhibits replication of encephalitic Alpha and Orthobunyaviruses in multi-cellular central nervous system cultures. These lipid-specific IgMs trigger microglia to produce IFN-\u03b2 in a cGAS-STING-dependent manner, which induces an IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-receptor 1-dependent antiviral response in glia and neurons. These data identify lipid-reactive IgM as a mediator of anti-viral activity in the nervous system and provide a rational explanation why intrathecal synthesis of lipid-reactive IgM correlates with a reduced incidence of iatrogenic PML in MS.", "545": "To assess the pooled risk of cancer in patients with multiple sclerosis.", "546": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) where immunopathology is thought to be mediated by myelin-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper (TH) cells. The TH cells most commonly implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease are of TH1 and TH17 lineage, which are defined by the production of interferon-\u03b3 and interleukin-17, respectively. Moreover, there is emerging evidence for the involvement of TH17.1 cells, which share the hallmarks of TH1 and TH17 subsets. In this review, we summarise current knowledge about the potential role of TH17 subsets in the initiation and progression of the disease and put a focus on their response to approved immunomodulatory MS drugs. In this regard, TH17 cells are abundant in peripheral blood, cerebrospinal fluid and brain lesions of MS patients, and their counts and inflammatory mediators are further increased during relapses. Fingolimod and alemtuzumab induce a paramount decrease in central memory T cells, which harbour the majority of peripheral TH17 cells, while the efficacy of natalizumab, dimethyl fumarate and importantly hematopoietic stem cell therapy correlates with TH17.1 cell inhibition. Interestingly, also CD20 antibodies target highly inflammatory TH cells and hamper TH17 differentiation by IL-6 reductions. Moreover, recovery rates of TH cells best correlate with long-term efficacy after therapeutical immunodepletion.

The aims of this study were (1) to compare clinical features and physical performance in healthy controls, and PwMS with and without cognitive impairment, and (2) to determine the relationship between cognitive domains and demographics characteristics, clinical features and physical performance in PwMS. A total of 112 PwMS and 25 healthy controls participated in this study. Cognitive functions were evaluated by Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests (BRB-N). Based on cognitive performances by BRB-N, PwMS were divided into two groups as MS patients with impaired (MS-I, n: 57) and with normal (MS-N, n: 55) cognitive functions. For clinical features, fatigue, mood and sleep quality were evaluated by the Fatigue Impact Scale, Beck's Depression Inventory, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, respectively. For physical performances, balance and walking capacity were evaluated by posturography and Six-Minute Walking Test, respectively. The results showed that the education years, postural stability and walking capacity in MS-N and healthy controls were higher than in MS-I (P < 0.05). In addition, visuospatial memory was correlated with both postural stability under all sensory conditions and walking capacity; verbal memory was correlated with education years, postural stability on eyes closed-foam surface and walking capacity; verbal fluency was correlated with only walking capacity; information processing speed was correlated with education years, postural stability under all sensory conditions and walking capacity (P < 0.001).

Treatment of OSA has not previously been investigated as a potential modality to improve cognition in MS patients. Therefore, we sought to investigate the potential effects of OSA treatment on both cognitive function and fatigue in MS patients. Twenty-three participants with MS reporting significant fatigue were enrolled. CI was assessed by the Brief International Cognitive Assessment in MS and the 3-second Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test. All participants underwent overnight polysomnography to assess for possible OSA. Cognitive and fatigue measures were repeated in those subsequently treated for OSA and in a comparative untreated sample. Seven participants (30%) had a diagnosis of OSA based on an apnoea-hypopnea index greater than 5 per hour, with no correlation between the presence of CI and OSA. Verbal learning at follow-up assessment was seen to improve significantly in those treated for OSA, compared with those who were not treated for a sleep disorder.

In addition, we identify Gsta4 as a target of both dimethyl fumarate, an existing MS therapy, and clemastine fumarate, a candidate remyelinating agent in MS. Overexpression of Gsta4 reduces expression of Fas and activity of the mitochondria-associated Casp8-Bid-axis in adult oligodendrocyte precursor cells, leading to improved OL survival during differentiation. The Gsta4 effect on apoptosis during adult OL differentiation was corroborated in vivo in both lysolecithin-induced demyelination and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models, where Casp8 activity was reduced in Gsta4-overexpressing OLs.

Importantly, these failed clinical trials are informative experiments that can help us to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying MS. In several trials, concepts taken from experimental models were not translatable to humans, although they did not lack a well-considered pathophysiological rationale. The lessons learned from these discrepancies may benefit future studies and reduce the risks for patients. This review summarizes trials on MS since 2015 that have either failed or have been interrupted for various reasons. We identify potential causes of failure or inconclusiveness, looking at the path from basic animal experiments to clinical trials, and discuss the implications for our current view on MS pathogenesis, clinical practice, and future study designs.

In defiance of the breakthroughs in the knowledge of the pathogenesis and underlying mechanisms of various NDs, very little success has been achieved in developing effective therapies. This review draws a bead on the availability of the nutraceuticals to date for various NDs (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, vascular cognitive impairment, Prion disease, Spinocerebellar ataxia, Spinal muscular atrophy, Frontotemporal dementia, and Pick's disease) focusing on their various mechanisms of action in various in vivo and in vitro models of NDs. This review is distinctive in its compilation to critically review preclinical and clinical studies of the maximum phytochemicals in amelioration and prevention of almost all kinds of neurodegenerative diseases and address their possible mechanism of action. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library searches were used for preclinical studies, while ClinicalTrials.gov and PubMed were searched for clinical updates. The results from preclinical studies demonstrate the efficacious effects of the phytochemicals in various NDs while clinical reports showing mixed results with promise for phytochemical use as an adjunct to the conventional treatment in various NDs. These studies together suggest that phytochemicals can significantly act upon different mechanisms of disease such as oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptotic pathways, and gene regulation. However, further clinical studies are needed that should include the appropriate biomarkers of NDs and the effect of phytochemicals on them as well as targeting the appropriate population.", "564": "The gut microbiome is increasingly implicated in modifying susceptibility to and progression of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs).

We assess animal studies of genetic and environmental models for NDs that investigate how manipulations of the microbiome causally impact the development of behavioral and neuropathological endophenotypes of disease. We additionally evaluate the likely immunological, neuronal, and metabolic mechanisms for how the gut microbiota may modulate risk for NDs.

Previous studies have shown that MIF is expressed in neocortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and spinal cord in adult mice. It is expressed by astrocytes and activates microglias in neuroinflammation. Further studies have shown that MIF is detected in moss fibers of dentate granule cells and in apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in adult hippocampus. Only NeuroD-positive immature granule neurons but not NeuN-positive mature neurons express MIF. These findings led us eager to know the exact role of MIF in the development of hippocampus. Therefore, we systematically checked the spatial and temporal expression pattern of MIF and characterized MIF-positive cells in hippocampus from mice aged from postnatal day 0 (P0) to 3 months. Our results showed that the lowest level of MIF protein occurred at P7 and <i>mif</i> mRNA increased from P0, reached a peak at P7, and stably expressed until P30 before declining dramatically at 3 months. MIF was localized in fibers of GFAP- and BLBP-positive radial glial precursor cells in dentate gyrus (DG). DCX-expressing newly generated neurons were MIF-negative. Inhibition of MIF by MIF antagonist S, R-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4, 5-dihydro-5-isoxazole acetic acid methyl ester (ISO-1) reduced BrdU-positive cells. Interestingly, MIF was expressed by NeuN-positive GABAergic interneurons including parvalbumin-and Reelin-expressing cells in the DG. Neither NeuN-positive granule cells nor NeuN-positive pyramidal neurons expressed MIF. In transgenic mice, POMC-EGFP-positive immature dentate granule cells and Thy1-EGFP-positive mature granule cells were MIF-negative. Treatment of neuronal cultures with ISO-1 inhibited neurite outgrowth. Therefore, we conclude that MIF might be important for feature maintenance of neural stem cells and neurite outgrowth during hippocampal development.", "569": "<b>Background:</b> First dose observation for cardiac effects is required for fingolimod. Previous results in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) suggest that transient bradycardia and conduction abnormalities during the observation phase are rare, benign and reversible. Prior analyses corroborate these findings. The present large scale dataset allows subgroup analyses for differences in the incidence of cardiac findings depending on patient characteristics. <b>Methods:</b> START was an open-label, multi-center study that enrolled 6,998 RRMS patients. Primary endpoints were incidence of bradycardia (heart rate < 45 bpm) and second-/third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block during treatment initiation. Subgroup analyses were performed according to age, gender, body mass index (BMI), baseline expanded disability status scale (EDSS), and concomitant medication to determine the impact of these variables on cardiac outcomes parameters. <b>Results:</b> 63 patients (0.9%) developed bradycardia (<45 bpm), 120 patients (1.7%) had a second-degree Mobitz I (Wenkebach) block and/or 2:1 AV block. One case of an asymptomatic third-degree AV block occurred. No Mobitz II AV block was observed. After 1 week, no second-/third-degree AV block was observed. The incidence of second- or third-degree AV blocks was significantly higher in older patients (\u226550 years; <i>p</i> = 0.014 vs. patients 35-49 years). Second- or third-degree AV blocks were more frequent in females (87.5% of all patients with a second- or third-degree AV block; <i>p</i> < 0.001), while bradycardia occurred more often in males (58.7% of all bradycardia events; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Furthermore, patients with a BMI below 25 had a higher incidence of second- or third-degree AV block. <b>Conclusions:</b> In summary, transient bradycardia and AV conduction abnormalities after the first dose of fingolimod were rare and asymptomatic. When compared to females, male patients might have a higher risk for bradycardia during treatment initiation, presumably due to a lower resting heart rate. Furthermore, a low heart rate before treatment initiation, low body weight, or low BMI possibly increases the risk for bradycardia. Second- or third-degree AV blocks were more frequent in females, older patients and patients with a low BMI. Nevertheless, these cardiac events remained rare and benign, confirming the favorable cardiac safety profile of fingolimod upon treatment initiation in MS patients without cardiovascular comorbidities.", "570": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a systemic autoimmune disease that often leads to fibrosis of multiple organs, and there are no effective treatments. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a highly evolutionarily conserved transcription factor activated by endogenous and exogenous ligands and that regulate cell proliferation, tumorigenesis and immune balance. Recently, it have reported AhR signaling may participate in fibrosis process, usually consider as a negative regulator of TGF-\u03b2. However, the detailed relationship between AhR and SSc has not been reported yet. Here we firstly found that AhR and CYP1A1 downregulated in SSc fibroblast(n\u00a0=\u00a06). The AhR ligand-Ficz negatively regulates TGF-\u03b21, COL1A1 and \u03b1-SMA expression, also enhances the MMP-1 expression via the AhR signaling activation. Conversely the AhR antagonist CH223191 could inhibit this effect. Furthermore, the antifibrosis effect of AhR signaling activation was also confirmed in bleomycin induced scleroderma mouse model. In conclusion, AhR signaling activation balances the extracellular matrix (ECM) composition and deposition, which may provide a new sight to the pathogenesis of SSc and AhR signaling activation may be a potential therapy for SSc.", "571": "Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein immunoglobulin G associated optic neuritis (MOG-ON) is a recently described entity.

Interestingly, data indicate that the cytoprotective effects of PERK activation on oligodendrocytes during EAE are not mediated by activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) but are accompanied by activation of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB). NF-\u03baB plays a critical role in MS and EAE; however, the effects of NF-\u03baB activation on oligodendrocytes in these diseases remain elusive. Herein, we generated a mouse model that allow for activation of NF-\u03baB specifically in oligodendrocytes and found that enhanced NF-\u03baB activation in oligodendrocytes had a minimal effect on their viability and function under normal conditions (both male and female mice). Interestingly, we found that enhanced NF-\u03baB activation in oligodendrocytes attenuated EAE disease severity and ameliorated EAE-induced oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination, and axon degeneration, without affecting inflammation (female mice). Moreover, we showed that the detrimental effects of PERK inactivation in oligodendrocytes in EAE were accompanied by impaired NF-\u03baB activation in oligodendrocytes, and were completely rescued by enhanced NF-\u03baB activation in oligodendrocytes (female mice). These findings suggest that NF-\u03baB activation accounts for the cytoprotective effects of PERK activation on oligodendrocytes in MS and EAE.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) is activated in oligodendrocytes in multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE); however, the role of NF-\u03baB activation in oligodendrocytes in MS and EAE remains elusive. Herein, we generated a mouse model that allows for activation of NF-\u03baB selectively in oligodendrocytes and demonstrated that NF-\u03baB activation prevented oligodendrocyte death and myelin damage in the EAE model. We further demonstrated that NF-\u03baB activation contributed to the protective effects of pancreatic ER kinase (PERK) activation on oligodendrocytes in the EAE model. As such, this work will facilitate the development of new treatments that enhance oligodendrocyte survival in MS patients by targeting the PERK-NF-\u03baB pathway.", "573": "Peptides mimicking antigenic epitopes targeted by antibodies can be powerful tools to be used as antigen surrogates for the specific diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune diseases. Obtaining structural insights about the nature of peptide-antibody interaction in complex mixtures such as sera is a critical goal. In multiple sclerosis (MS), we previously demonstrated that the N-linked \u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl moieties (N-Glc) containing epitopes in nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae adhesin C-terminal portion HMW1(1205-1526) were essential for high-affinity antibody binding in a subpopulation of MS patients. With the aim of developing peptide probes and assessing their binding properties to antibodies from sera of representative patients, we performed the systematic analysis of synthetic peptides based on HMW1(1347-1354) fragment bearing one or two N-Glc respectively on Asn-1349 and/or Asn-1352. The N-glucosylated nonapeptides efficiently bind to IgG antibodies, displaying IC<sub>50</sub> in the range 10<sup>-8</sup> -10<sup>-10</sup> M by competitive indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in three representative MS patient sera. We selected the di-N-glucosylated adhesin peptide Ac-KAN (Glc)VTLN (Glc)TT-NH<sub>2</sub> as the shortest sequence able to inhibit high-avidity interaction with N-Glc targeting IgM antibodies. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)- and circular dichroism (CD)-based characterization showed that the binding properties of these antigens could not be ascribed to structural differences induced by the presence of up to two N-glucosyl moieties.

However, current anti-inflammatory interventions depleting immune cells or directly targeting their trafficking into the CNS can have serious side effects, highlighting a need for better immunomodulatory strategies. We detected increased Reelin concentrations in the serum of patients with MS, resulting in increased endothelial permeability to leukocytes through increased nuclear factor \u03baB-mediated expression of vascular adhesion molecules. We thus investigated the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of Reelin immunodepletion in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and further validated the results in Reelin knockout mice. Removal of plasma Reelin by either approach protected against neuroinflammation and largely abolished the neurological consequences by reducing endothelial permeability and immune cell accumulation in the CNS. Our findings suggest Reelin depletion as a therapeutic approach with an inherent good safety margin for the treatment of MS and other diseases where leukocyte extravasation is a major driver of pathogenicity.", "576": "Approximately 60% of people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) suffer from upper limb dysfunction.

CD4+ T helper 17 (Th17) cells, characterized by IL-17 production, play important roles in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases (such as arthritis, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, among others) and in the host response to infection and cancer. Here, we demonstrate that human CD4+ T cells cells exposed to a Th17-differentiating milieu are significantly more resistant to immune suppression by CD8+ T cells compared to control Th0 cells. This resistance is mediated, in part, through the action of IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-17AF heterodimer through their receptors (IL-17RA and IL-17RC) on CD4+ T cells themselves, but not through their action on CD8+ T cells or APC. We further show that IL-17 can directly act on non-Th17 effector CD4+ T cells to induce suppressive resistance, and this resistance can be reversed by blockade of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, or STAT3. These studies reveal a role for IL-17 cytokines in mediating CD4-intrinsic immune resistance.

Purpose To validate a new short repetition time (TR) adiabatic inversion recovery (STAIR) prepared UTE (STAIR-UTE) sequence designed to suppress water signals and to allow imaging of ultrashort T2 protons of myelin in white matter using a clinical 3-T scanner. Materials and Methods In this prospective study, an optimization framework was used to obtain the optimal inversion time for nulling water signals using STAIR-UTE imaging at different TRs. Numeric simulation and phantom studies were performed. Healthy volunteers and participants with multiple sclerosis (MS) underwent MRI between November 2018 and October 2019 to compare STAIR-UTE and a clinical T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence for assessment of MS lesions. UTE measures of myelin were also performed to allow comparison of signals in lesions and with those in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in patients with MS and in normal white matter (NWM) in healthy volunteers. Results Simulation and phantom studies both suggest that the proposed STAIR-UTE technique can effectively suppress long T2 tissues with a broad range of T1s. Ten healthy volunteers (mean age, 33 years \u00b1 8 [standard deviation]; six women) and 10 patients with MS (mean age, 51 years \u00b1 16; seven women) were evaluated. The three-dimensional STAIR-UTE sequence effectively suppressed water components in white matter and selectively imaged myelin, which had a measured T2* value of 0.21 msec \u00b1 0.04 in the volunteer study. A much lower mean UTE measure of myelin proton density was found in MS lesions (3.8 mol/L \u00b1 1.5), and a slightly lower mean UTE measure was found in NAWM (7.2 mol/L \u00b1 0.8) compared with that in NWM (8.0 mol/L \u00b1 0.8) in the healthy volunteers (<i>P</i> < .001 for both comparisons). Conclusion The short repetition time adiabatic inversion recovery-prepared ultrashort echo time sequence provided efficient water signal suppression for volumetric imaging of myelin in the brain and showed excellent myelin signal contrast as well as marked ultrashort echo time signal reduction in multiple sclerosis lesions and a smaller reduction in normal-appearing white matter compared with normal white matter in volunteers. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 <i>Online supplemental material is available for this article.</i> See also the editorial by Messina and Port in this issue.", "592": "Alexithymia, meaning no words for emotions is a common problem that could affect up to 53% of patients in multiple sclerosis (MS).", "593": "MTX is the most commonly recommended DMARD for first-line treatment of RA, however, it has been hypothesized to cause lung disease as an adverse effect.

DHODH is crucial for <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine biosynthesis and is the only mitochondrial enzyme in this pathway, thus conferring a link between inflammation, mitochondrial activity and axonal integrity. Here, we investigated how DHODH inhibition may affect mitochondrial behavior in the context of oxidative stress. We employed a model of transected murine spinal roots, previously developed in our laboratory. Using confocal live imaging of axonal mitochondria, we showed that in unmanipulated axons, TFN increased significantly the mitochondria length without altering their transport features. In mitochondria challenged with 50\u2009\u00b5M hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) to induce oxidative stress, the presence of TFN at 1\u2009\u00b5M concentration was able to restore mitochondrial shape, motility, as well as mitochondrial oxidation potential to control levels.

Eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the terminal complement component 5, was shown to significantly reduce the risk of NMOSD relapse in a Phase III placebo-controlled trial. Based on this, eculizumab (Soliris<sup>\u00ae</sup>) was the first drug to be formally approved for the treatment of anti-AQP4-antibody positive NMOSD in 2019.", "596": "There are more than five hundred internal medicine residency programs in the USA, involving 27,000 residents.

However, as yet little research of this type has focused on multiple sclerosis (MS).", "598": "Multiple sclerosis is a chronic and demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), most prevalent in women, and with an important social and economic cost worldwide. It is triggered by self-reacting lymphocytes that infiltrate the CNS and initiate neuroinflammation. Further, axonal loss and neuronal death takes place, leading to neurodegeneration and brain atrophy. The murine model for studying MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), consists in immunizing mice with myelin-derived epitopes. APCs activate encephalitogenic T CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes that migrate mainly to the spinal cord resulting in neuroinflammation. Most of the knowledge on the pathophysiology and treatment of MS was obtained from EAE experiments, as Th17 cells, anti-alpha4 blocking Abs and the role of microbiota. Conversely, recent technology breakthroughs, such as CyTOF and single-cell RNA-seq, promise to revolutionize our understanding on the mechanisms involved both in MS and EAE. In fact, the importance of specific cellular populations and key molecules in MS/EAE is a constant matter of debate. It is well accepted that both Th1 and Th17 T CD4 lymphocytes play a relevant role in disease initiation after re-activation in situ. What is still under constant investigation, however, is the plasticity of the lymphocyte population, and the individual contribution of both resident and inflammatory cells for the progression or recovery of the disease. Thus, in this review, new findings obtained after single-cell analysis of blood and central nervous system infiltrating cells from MS/EAE and how they have contributed to a better knowledge on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of neuroinflammation are discussed.", "599": "<i>Mycobacterium avium</i> subsp. <i>paratuberculosis</i> (MAP) is an understudied pathogen worldwide with continuous implications in human autoimmune diseases (ADs). The awareness of MAP appears to be low in many places and its research is at infant stage in many countries. The lack of worldwide coverage of the MAP research landscape calls for urgent research attention and prioritization. This present study aimed to assess MAP global research productivity with an emphasis on its implications in ADs via bibliometric and growth analytic frameworks from authors, countries, institutions, international, disciplines and collaboration network perspectives. MAP primary articles were retrieved from the Scopus database and the Web of Science from 1911 to 2019 via title-specific algorithm. Analytic results of dataset yielded a total of 3889 articles from 581 journals and 20.65 average citations per documents. The annual growth rate of MAP research for the period was 6.31%. Based on a country's productivity (articles (%), freq. of publication (%)), the USA (887 (22.81%), 26.72%), and Australia (236 (6.07%), 6.07%) ranked the top 2 countries but Egypt and Germany had the highest average growth rate (AGR, 170%) in the last 3 years. MAP studies are generally limited to Europe, Australia, Asia, South America and few nations in Africa. It had positive growth rate (30%-100%) in relation to type 1 diabetes mellitus and rheumatoid arthritis ADs; food science and technology, immunology, agriculture, pathology, and research and experimental medicine, wildlife, environments, virulence, disease resistance, meat and meat products, osteopontin, waste milk and slurry/sludge digestion subjects; but negative growth (-130% to -30%) in ulcerative colitis and Parkinson's disease and no growth in multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, thyroid disorders, psoriasis, and lupus. The mapping revealed a gross lack of collaboration networking in terms of authorship, (intra- and inter-) nationally and institutionally with a generalized collaboration index of 1.82. In conclusion, inadequate resources-, knowledge- and scientific-networking hampered growth and awareness of MAP research globally. The study recommends further research to strengthen evidence of MAP's epidemiologic prevalence in ADs and proffer practical solution(s) for drug development and point-of-care diagnostics amongst other extended themes.", "600": "Many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis, and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are associated with systemic inflammation. Inflammation itself results in increased blood content of fibrinogen (Fg), called hyperfibrinogenemia (HFg). Fg is not only considered an acute phase protein and a marker of inflammation, but has been shown that it can cause inflammatory responses. Fibrin deposits have been associated with memory reduction in neuroinflammatory diseases such as AD and TBI. Reduction in short-term memory has been seen during the most common form of TBI, mild-to-moderate TBI. Fibrin deposits have been found in brains of patients with mild-to-moderate TBI. The vast majority of the literature emphasizes the role of fibrin-activated microglia as the mediator in the neuroinflammation pathway. However, the recent discovery that astrocytes, which constitute approximately 30% of the cells in the mammalian central nervous system, manifest different reactive states warrants further investigations in the causative role of HFg in astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation. Our previous study showed that Fg deposited in the vasculo-astrocyte interface-activated astrocytes. However, little is known of how Fg directly affects astrocytes and neurons. In this review, we summarize studies that show the effect of Fg on different types of cells in the vasculo-neuronal unit. We will also discuss the possible mechanism of HFg-induced neuroinflammation during TBI.", "601": "Multiple sclerosis is a neurodegenerative, autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. Both peripheral blood and central nervous system facets play a role in the pathophysiology. Extracellular vesicles are small membrane-bound vesicles that are released by most cells in response to stress, activation, or pathology. As extracellular vesicles can cross the blood-brain barrier, they have the ability to link peripheral blood inflammation to central nervous system pathology in multiple sclerosis. The aim of this study was to obtain a comprehensive picture of the cellular origins of plasma-borne extracellular particles in multiple sclerosis.", "602": "Chronic inflammation is a common feature of obesity, with elevated cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) in the circulation and tissues. Here, we report an unconventional IL-1R-MyD88-IRAK2-PHB/OPA1 signaling axis that reprograms mitochondrial metabolism in adipocytes to exacerbate obesity. IL-1 induced recruitment of IRAK2 Myddosome to mitochondria outer membranes via recognition by TOM20, followed by TIMM50-guided translocation of IRAK2 into mitochondria inner membranes, to suppress oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation, thereby attenuating energy expenditure. Adipocyte-specific MyD88 or IRAK2 deficiency reduced high-fat-diet-induced weight gain, increased energy expenditure and ameliorated insulin resistance, associated with a smaller adipocyte size and increased cristae formation. IRAK2 kinase inactivation also reduced high-fat diet-induced metabolic diseases. Mechanistically, IRAK2 suppressed respiratory super-complex formation via interaction with PHB1 and OPA1 upon stimulation of IL-1. Taken together, our results suggest that the IRAK2 Myddosome functions as a critical link between inflammation and metabolism, representing a novel therapeutic target for patients with obesity.", "603": "Dysautonomic symptoms (DS) are frequent but often underrecognized in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, despite the relevant impact on quality of life and physical performance.", "604": "A lack of movement coordination characterized by the undershoot or overshoot of the intended location with the hand, arm, or leg is often found in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS).

Inertial sensors facilitate in performing quantitative motion analysis and by estimating body symmetry more accurately assess coordination lesion and imbalance.", "605": "During T cell development in mice, thymic negative selection deletes cells with the potential to recognize and react to self-antigens. In human T cell-dependent autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis, T cells reactive to autoantigens are thought to escape negative selection, traffic to the periphery and attack self-tissues. However, physiological thymic negative selection of autoreactive human T cells has not been previously studied. We now describe a human T-cell receptor-transgenic humanized mouse model that permits the study of autoreactive T-cell development in a human thymus. Our studies demonstrate that thymocytes expressing the autoreactive Clone 5 TCR, which recognizes insulin B:9-23 presented by HLA-DQ8, are efficiently negatively selected at the double and single positive stage in human immune systems derived from HLA-DQ8<sup>+</sup> HSCs. In the absence of hematopoietic expression of the HLA restriction element, negative selection of Clone 5 is less efficient and restricted to the single positive stage. To our knowledge, these data provide the first demonstration of negative selection of human T cells recognizing a naturally-expressed tissue-restricted antigen. Intrathymic antigen presenting cells are required to delete less mature thymocytes, while presentation by medullary thymic epithelial cells may be sufficient to delete more mature single positive cells. These observations set the stage for investigation of putative defects in negative selection in human autoimmune diseases.", "606": "Over the last few years, immune cell metabolism has become one of the most stimulating areas of investigation in the field of immunology. Compelling evidence has revealed that metabolic pathways are closely associated to cell functions and immune cells adopt defined metabolic programs to sustain their activity and respond to micro-environmental demands. It is now clear that alterations in cell metabolism can favour dysregulation typical of autoreactive immune cells, thus sustaining loss of immunological self-tolerance. In this short review, we highlight the main metabolic alterations associated with both innate and adaptive immune cells in autoimmune conditions, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and type 1 diabetes (T1D). We also summarize recent findings reporting the use of pharmacological agents, which modulate the immunometabolism to possibly control immune responses during autoimmune disorders.", "607": "Patients with neurologic disorders present a unique set of challenges for knee surgeons because of contractures, muscle weakness, spasticity, and ligament instability.

We analysed plasma proteins in pMS by an untargeted proteomic approach. Patients with pMS (Group pMS, n\u00a0=\u00a033), patients with demyelinating disease not meeting pMS diagnostic criteria (unclassified demyelinating disease, Group U, n\u00a0=\u00a04) and age-matched healthy subjects (Group C, n\u00a0=\u00a040) were included. Plasma proteomic analysis was performed using Q-TOF LC/MS. Proteins having fold change >1.2 and found to be statistically different (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) between the groups were identified and discussed with a clinical perspective. Group pMS had higher alpha 1B glycoprotein (A1BG), complement factor B (CFB), plasminogen (PLG), alpha-2-antiplasmin (\u03b1<sub>2</sub>-AP, SERPINF2), inter alpha trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H2 (ITIH2), and lower centrosomal protein of 290 (CEP290) and F-box/LRR-repeat protein 17 (FBXL17) concentrations than Group C. Measurements from Group U, whose definite diagnoses were established as pMS (n\u00a0=\u00a03) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (n\u00a0=\u00a01) on follow-up after the study, were statistically close to the results of Group pMS. Plasma protein changes observed in our study were related to the inflammation, coagulation and oxidative stress pathways. If confirmed and validated in larger groups, these results may indicate potential biomarker(s) for demyelinating diseases at proteome level and could encourage studies for the development of novel diagnostic kits.", "609": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) with unpredictable clinical outcome. As such, there is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that can predict the treatment response. Therefore, in an open-label, clinical, paraclinical and molecular prospective study, we assessed 50 interferon (IFN) treated MS patients for Rio Score (RS)/Modified Rio Score (MRS) and densitometric expression of the interferon-induced protein 35 (IFI35), a signal-protein with potential to be clinically relevant in the management of the disease. We found 4.92-fold upregulated IFI35 in IFN-treated MS group respect to healthy controls (p\u00a0<\u00a0.0001) and 2.31-fold respect to untreated MS group (p\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). Moreover, IFI35 expression profile correlated with RS and MRS rank values (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.6018, p\u00a0<\u00a0.0001; r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.620, p\u00a0<\u00a0.0001), white matter volume (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.5041; p\u00a0=\u00a0.0017) and cerebral lesion load (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.5075; p\u00a0=\u00a0.0026). Finally, the main proportion of IFN-treated MS patients non-reaching the 65% threshold in IFI35 expression leaved the RS/MRS rank value 0 in a period ranging from 5 to 15\u00a0months (p\u00a0<\u00a0.0001) from the study entry; instead, all patients that reaching this threshold maintained the RS/MRS value 0 until the study end (p\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). In conclusion, the expression level of IFI35 in untreated MS patients highlights a correlation with neuroinflammation. Furthermore, IFI35 expression in IFN-treated MS patients shows a modular correlation between dosing regimes, which is predictive for long-term clinical outcome and drug efficacy.", "610": "Neurodegenerative diseases are the second most common cause of death and characterized by progressive impairments in movement or mental functioning in the central or peripheral nervous system. The prevention of neurodegenerative disorders has become an emerging public health challenge for our society. Melatonin, a pineal hormone, has various physiological functions in the brain, including regulating circadian rhythms, clearing free radicals, inhibiting biomolecular oxidation, and suppressing neuroinflammation. Cumulative evidence indicates that melatonin has a wide range of neuroprotective roles by regulating pathophysiological mechanisms and signaling pathways. Moreover, melatonin levels are decreased in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the regulation, molecular mechanisms and biological functions of melatonin in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, vascular dementia and multiple sclerosis. We also discuss the clinical application of melatonin in neurodegenerative disorders. This information will lead to a better understanding of the regulation of melatonin in the brain and provide therapeutic options for the treatment of various neurodegenerative diseases.", "611": "Ocrelizumab is a novel humanized anti-CD20 antibody used for treatment of relapsing remitting and primary progressive multiple sclerosis with evidence of inflammatory activity.

Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in immune cells is regulated by stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and its activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel ORAI1. We here identify patients with a novel mutation in STIM1 (p.L374P) that abolished Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and resulted in increased susceptibility to fungal and other infections. In mice, deletion of STIM1 in all immune cells enhanced susceptibility to mucosal C.\u00a0albicans infection, whereas T cell-specific deletion of STIM1 impaired immunity to systemic C.\u00a0albicans infection. STIM1 deletion impaired the production of Th17 cytokines essential for antifungal immunity and compromised the expression of genes in several metabolic pathways including Foxo and HIF1\u03b1 signaling that regulate glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Our study further revealed distinct roles of STIM1 in regulating transcription and metabolic programs in non-pathogenic Th17 cells compared to pathogenic, proinflammatory Th17 cells, a finding that may potentially be exploited for the treatment of Th17 cell-mediated inflammatory diseases.", "614": "Peripheral nervous system (PNS) neurons support axon regeneration into adulthood, whereas central nervous system (CNS) neurons lose regenerative ability after development. To better understand this decline whilst aiming to improve regeneration, we focused on phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and its product phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub> ). We demonstrate that adult PNS neurons utilise two catalytic subunits of PI3K for axon regeneration: p110\u03b1 and p110\u03b4. However, in the CNS, axonal PIP<sub>3</sub> decreases with development at the time when axon transport declines and regenerative competence is lost. Overexpressing p110\u03b1 in CNS neurons had no effect; however, expression of p110\u03b4 restored axonal PIP<sub>3</sub> and increased regenerative axon transport. p110\u03b4 expression enhanced CNS regeneration in both rat and human neurons and in transgenic mice, functioning in the same way as the hyperactivating H1047R mutation of p110\u03b1. Furthermore, viral delivery of p110\u03b4 promoted robust regeneration after optic nerve injury. These findings establish a deficit of axonal PIP<sub>3</sub> as a key reason for intrinsic regeneration failure and demonstrate that native p110\u03b4 facilitates axon regeneration by functioning in a hyperactive fashion.", "615": "<b>Background:</b> Multiple Sclerosis Partners Advancing Technology and Health Solutions (MS PATHS) is the first example of a learning health system in multiple sclerosis (MS). This paper describes the initial implementation of MS PATHS and initial patient characteristics. <b>Methods:</b> MS PATHS is an ongoing initiative conducted in 10 healthcare institutions in three countries, each contributing standardized information acquired during routine care. Institutional participation required the following: active MS patient census of \u2265500, at least one Siemens 3T magnetic resonance imaging scanner, and willingness to standardize patient assessments, share standardized data for research, and offer universal enrolment to capture a representative sample. The eligible participants have diagnosis of MS, including clinically isolated syndrome, and consent for sharing pseudonymized data for research. MS PATHS incorporates a self-administered patient assessment tool, the Multiple Sclerosis Performance Test, to collect a structured history, patient-reported outcomes, and quantitative testing of cognition, vision, dexterity, and walking speed. Brain magnetic resonance imaging is acquired using standardized acquisition sequences on Siemens 3T scanners. Quantitative measures of brain volume and lesion load are obtained. Using a separate consent, the patients contribute DNA, RNA, and serum for future research. The clinicians retain complete autonomy in using MS PATHS data in patient care. A shared governance model ensures transparent data and sample access for research. <b>Results:</b> As of August 5, 2019, MS PATHS enrolment included participants (<i>n</i> = 16,568) with broad ranges of disease subtypes, duration, and severity. Overall, 14,643 (88.4%) participants contributed data at one or more time points. The average patient contributed 15.6 person-months of follow-up (95% CI: 15.5-15.8); overall, 166,158 person-months of follow-up have been accumulated. Those with relapsing-remitting MS demonstrated more demographic heterogeneity than the participants in six randomized phase 3 MS treatment trials. Across sites, a significant variation was observed in the follow-up frequency and the patterns of disease-modifying therapy use. <b>Conclusions:</b> Through digital health technology, it is feasible to collect standardized, quantitative, and interpretable data from each patient in busy MS practices, facilitating the merger of research and patient care. This approach holds promise for data-driven clinical decisions and accelerated systematic learning.", "616": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a CNS disease characterized by immune-mediated demyelination and progressive axonal loss. MS-related CNS damage and its clinical course have two main phases: active and inactive/progressive. Reliable biomarkers are being sought to allow identification of MS pathomechanisms and prediction of its course. The purpose of this study was to identify sphingolipid (SL) species as candidate biomarkers of inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes underlying MS pathology. We performed sphingolipidomic analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to determine the lipid profiles in post mortem specimens from the normal appearing white matter (NAWM) of normal CNS (nCNS), from subjects with chronic MS (active and inactive lesions) as well as from patients with other neurological diseases. Distinctive SL modification patterns occurred in specimens from MS patients with chronic inactive plaques with respect to NAWM from nCNS and active MS lesions. Chronic inactive MS lesions were characterized by decreased level of dihydroceramide (dhCer), ceramide, and sphingomyelin subspecies whereas level of hexosylceramide and ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) subspecies was significantly increased in comparison to NAWM of nCNS as well as active MS plaques. In contrast, active MS lesions were characterized by a significant increase of major dhCer subspecies in comparison to NAWM of nCNS. These results suggest the existence of different SL metabolic pathways in the active versus inactive phase within progressive stage of MS. Moreover, they suggest that C1P could be a new biomarker of inactive MS progressive phase, and its detection may help to develop future prognostic and therapeutic strategies for the disease.", "617": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a multifactorial, central nervous system, immune-mediated disease characterized by inflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration. Evidence suggests a steady rise in MS prevalence over the past five decades in the United States and around the world.

Evidence suggests that oxidative/nitroxidative stress is an important contributor to MS etiology, progression, and clinical symptoms. A multifaceted treatment approach aimed at counteracting oxidative/nitroxidative stress including MS disease-modifying medications, Mediterranean style diet, stress-relieving activities, smoking and alcohol cessation, exercise, and peer support programs is the best way to treat the disease.", "618": "The epidemiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) is important for planning disease modifying therapy (DMT).

Current understanding and treatment for reversing of the fibrotic process is limited in systemic sclerosis (SSc). We have developed a network-based analysis for drug effects that takes into account the human interactome network, proximity measures between drug targets and disease-associated genes, genome-wide gene expression and disease modules that emerge through pertinent analysis. Currently used and potential drugs showed a wide variation in proximity to SSc-associated genes and distinctive proximity to the SSc-relevant pathways, depending on their class and targets. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TyKIs) approach disease gene through multiple pathways, including both inflammatory and fibrosing processes. The SSc disease module includes the emerging molecular targets and is in better accord with the current knowledge of the pathophysiology of the disease. In the disease-module network, the greatest perturbing activity was shown by nintedanib, followed by imatinib, dasatinib, and acetylcysteine. Suppression of the SSc-relevant pathways and alleviation of the skin fibrosis was remarkable in the inflammatory subsets of the SSc patients receiving TyKI therapy. Our results show that network-based drug-disease proximity offers a novel perspective into a drug's therapeutic effect in the SSc disease module. This could be applied to drug combinations or drug repositioning, and be helpful guiding clinical trial design and subgroup analysis.", "622": "Understanding of the role of focal inflammation, a treatable feature, on neuro-axonal injury, is paramount to optimize neuroprotective strategy in MS. To quantify the impact of focal inflammatory activity on the rate of neuro-axonal injury over the MS course. We quantified the annualized rates of change in peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell plus inner plexiform layer (GCIPL), whole-brain, gray matter and thalamic volumes in patients with and without focal inflammatory activity in 161 patients followed over 5\u00a0years. We used mixed models including focal inflammatory activity (the presence of at least one relapse or a new/enlarging T2-FLAIR or gadolinium- enhancing lesion), and its interaction with time adjusted by age, sex, use of disease-modifying therapies and steroids, and prior optic neuritis. The increased rate of neuro-axonal injury during the first five years after onset was more prominent among active patients, as reflected by the changes in GCIPL thickness (p\u2009=\u20090.02), whole brain (p\u2009=\u20090.002) and thalamic volumes (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Thereafter, rates of retinal and brain changes stabilized and were similar in active and stable patients.

At present, there is no definitive cure, and the few available disease-modifying options display either poor efficacy or life-threatening side effects. There is clear evidence that relapsing-remitting clinical attacks in MS are driven by inflammatory demyelination and that the subsequent disease steps, being irresponsive to immunotherapy, result from neurodegeneration. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) stands halfway between three key pathomechanisms underlying MS, namely inflammation, neurodegeneration and oxidative stress, thus representing a kingpin for the identification of novel therapeutic targets in MS.

It plays a pivotal role in maintaining central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis by regulating the exchange of materials between the circulation and the brain and protects the neural tissue from neurotoxic components as well as pathogens. Here, we discuss the development of the BBB in physiological conditions and then focus on the role of the BBB in cerebrovascular disease, including acute ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage, and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Finally, we summarize recent advancements in the development of therapies targeting the BBB and outline future directions and outstanding questions in the field. We propose that BBB dysfunction not only results from, but is causal in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders; the BBB is more a contributor to the disruption of CNS homeostasis than a victim in neurological disorders.", "631": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disabling neuroinflammatory disease. Its etiology is unknown, but both oxidative stress and inflammation appear to be involved in disease pathology. Macrophages are the predominant cell type in acute inflammatory brain lesions in MS. Macrophages produce proinflammatory and toxic molecules that promote demyelination and are key players in phagocytosis/degradation of myelin sheathes. Lipoic acid (LA) is an inexpensive, endogenously produced small molecule that exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Treatment with LA is protective in MS and other inflammatory diseases. To examine the mechanism(s) by which LA may attenuate inflammatory lesion activity in MS, we used healthy control and MS cells to evaluate the effects of LA on levels of inflammatory cytokines, phagocytosis and the immunomodulator cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). LA treatment resulted in a generally less inflammatory phenotype of monocytes and MDMs from healthy controls, and (to a lesser degree) MS donors. LA inhibited monocyte secretion of cytokines relevant to MS in monocytes, including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1\u03b2; LA effects on secretion of these cytokines in MDMs were mixed with inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, but stimulation of IL-1\u03b2, the latter perhaps as a result of altered macrophage polarization. LA inhibited phagocytosis in both monocytes and MDMs, and increased cAMP levels in monocytes. LA may modulate inflammatory cytokine secretion and phagocytosis via a cAMP-mediated mechanism.", "632": "NF-\u03baB signaling pathways are dysregulated in both the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral blood cells in multiple sclerosis (MS), but the cause of this is unknown. We have recently reported that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with MS have increased constitutive activation and translocation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB to the nucleus compared to healthy subjects. NF-\u03baB can be activated through either canonical or non-canonical pathways. In the canonical pathway, activation of NF-\u03baB is normally negatively regulated by the inhibitor I\u03baB. We therefore hypothesized that the increased activation of NF-\u03baB could be caused by reduced I\u03baB-\u03b1 in the cells of patients with MS, possibly due to increased activity of the I\u03baB kinase (IKK) complex, which regulates I\u03baB-\u03b1. Alternatively, changes to the activity of key molecules in the non-canonical pathway, such as IKK\u03b1, could also lead to increased NF-\u03baB activation. We therefore used Western blotting to detect I\u03baB-\u03b1 levels and ELISA to investigate NF-\u03baB DNA binding activity and phosphorylation of IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 in samples from PBMC of MS patients and controls. The level of full-length I\u03baB-\u03b1 protein in the cytosolic fraction of PBMC of MS patients was significantly reduced compared to healthy subjects, with significantly more evidence of multiple low molecular weight putative degradation products of I\u03baB-\u03b1 present in MS patients compared to healthy subjects. Conversely, the level of NF-\u03baB DNA binding activity was increased in whole cell lysates from MS patients. Both IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 showed increased overall activity in MS compared to healthy subjects, although not all of the MS patients showed increased activity compared to the healthy subjects, suggesting that there may be several different mechanisms underlying the constitutive activation of NF-\u03baB in MS. Taken together, these findings suggest that there may be multiple points at which the NF-\u03baB pathway is dysregulated in MS and that decreased levels of the full-length I\u03baB-\u03b1 protein are a major component in this.", "633": "Physical and cognitive symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) correlate with unemployment cross-sectionally.

However, the ON has several unique characteristics, such as an extremely high myelination level of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons throughout the length of the nerve (with virtually all fibers myelinated by 7 months of age in humans), lack of synapses and very narrow geometry. Moreover, the optic nerve head (ONH) - a region where the RGC axons exit the eye - represents an interesting area that is morphologically distinct in different species. In many cases of multiple sclerosis (demyelinating disease of the CNS) vision problems are the first manifestation of the disease, suggesting that RGCs and/or glia in the ON are more sensitive to pathological conditions than cells in other parts of the CNS. Here, we summarize current knowledge on glial organization and function in the ON, focusing on glial support of RGCs. We cover both well-established concepts on the important role of glial cells in ON health and new findings, including novel insights into mechanisms of remyelination, microglia/NG2 cell-cell interaction, astrocyte reactivity and the regulation of reactive astrogliosis by mitochondrial fragmentation in microglia.", "638": "The human 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) has been widely used as a measure of glial activation in health and disease.

However, findings in psychiatric disorders have prompted reassessment of the interpretation of regional TSPO expression differences in the brain, specifically with respect to potential neuroinflammatory components. This \"mini\" Review aims to guide readers through the complexity of TSPO imaging research by identifying the successes, challenges, and promising new directions of the field.

It is the most commonly seen autoimmune disorder. The incidence of disease and its prevalence are growing worldwide. Early identification of the disease and accurate diagnosis is important to prevent further complications and disability. The etiology remains unclear, and it is believed that complex gene-environment interactions play an essential role. Genetic predisposition only describes a portion of the disease risk, whereas lifestyle and environmental factors are significant contributors. Smoking was identified as an important risk factor for MS. The main objectives of this review were to examine the underlying mechanisms of immune dysregulation in the development of MS, explore the association between smoking and MS, and identify other genetic and environmental factors that alter the risk of developing the disease. We searched PubMed for articles relevant to the study topic published between 2000 and 2020 using the search terms \"multiple sclerosis,\" \"cigarette smoking,\" \"risk factors,\" and, \"epigenetics.\" Studies reveal a marked association between smoking and the risk of MS.

In contrast to adrenal steroid hormones that act on intracellular nuclear receptors, neurosteroids directly modulate plasma membrane ion channels and regulate intracellular signalling. This review provides an overview of the work that led to the discovery of neurosteroids, our current understanding of their intracellular biosynthetic machinery, and their roles in regulating the development and function of nervous tissue. Neurosteroids mediate signalling in the brain via multiple mechanisms. Here, we describe in detail their effects on GABA (inhibitory) and NMDA (excitatory) receptors, two signalling pathways of opposing function. Furthermore, emerging evidence points to altered neurosteroid function and signalling in neurological disease.

Despite aggressive surgical resection and adjuvant treatment, average survival remains approximately 14.6 months. The brain tumor microenvironment is heterogeneous, comprising multiple populations of tumor, stromal, and immune cells. Tumor cells evade the immune system by suppressing several immune functions to enable survival. Gliomas release immunosuppressive and tumor-supportive soluble factors into the microenvironment, leading to accelerated cancer proliferation, invasion, and immune escape. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from bone marrow, adipose tissue, or umbilical cord are a promising tool for cell-based therapies. One crucial mechanism mediating the therapeutic outcomes often seen in MSC application is their tropism to sites of injury. Furthermore, MSCs interact with host immune cells to regulate the inflammatory response, and data points to the possibility of using MSCs to achieve immunomodulation in solid tumors. Interleukin 1\u03b2, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, transforming growth factor \u03b2, and stromal cell-derived factor 1 are notably up-regulated in glioblastoma and dually promote immune and MSC trafficking. Mesenchymal stem cells have widely been regarded as hypoimmunogenic, enabling this cell-based administration across major histocompatibility barriers. In this review, we will highlight (1) the bidirectional communication of glioma cells and tumor-associated immune cells, (2) the inflammatory mediators enabling leukocytes and transplantable MSC migration, and (3) review preclinical and human clinical trials using MSCs as delivery vehicles. Mesenchymal stem cells possess innate abilities to migrate great distances, cross the blood-brain barrier, and communicate with surrounding cells, all of which make them desirable \"Trojan horses\" for brain cancer therapy.", "643": "Given the growing evidence of a link between gut microbiota (GM) dysbiosis and multiple sclerosis (MS), fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), aimed at rebuilding GM, has been proposed as a new therapeutic approach to MS treatment.

We provide evidence that FMT can rectify altered GM to some extent with a therapeutic effect on EAE. We also found that FMT led to reduced activation of microglia and astrocytes and conferred protection on the blood-brain barrier (BBB), myelin, and axons in EAE.

This has allowed many studies to provide novel mechanistic insights into certain brain pathologies, albeit at a still unsatisfying resolution, with masking of lowly expressed genes and regulatory elements in different cell types. The recent rapid evolution of single-cell technologies has now allowed researchers to shed light on human pathologies at a previously unreached resolution revealing further insights into pathological mechanisms that will open the way for the development of new strategies for therapies.

The aim of the study is to evaluate gonadal steroids and sperm quality in men at the time of RRMS diagnosis and 12 months following the first disease modifying treatment (DMT). <b>Results:</b> Out of 41 patients with RRMS, 38 were included in the study (age 40.3 \u00b1 12.3) to be compared with matched controls. Patients with RRMS showed no differences in gonadal steroids or sperm parameters, except for free testosterone (fT) plasma levels, which were lower in RRMS patients than controls (median 0.09 <i>vs</i>. 1.4, <i>p</i> < 0.0001).

Exposure to NTZ was defined as treatment with NTZ from 8 weeks prior to the start of the last menstrual period and onward. All patients completed a standardized questionnaire regarding pregnancy and newborn outcomes until the postpartum period for up to 12 months. <b>Results:</b> NTZ was stopped on average 46 days after the last menstrual period. There were 11 live births and one elective termination due to ectopic pregnancy. Mean gestational age of live born individuals was 39.0 weeks [standard deviation (SD) \u00b1 1.1]. Mean birth weight and length were 3,426 g (SD \u00b1 348) and 51.9 cm (SD \u00b1 1.9), respectively. Apgar scores 1 min after birth were normal, with 9.2 points on average.

In addition to these, there are \"antibody-negative\" demyelinating syndromes which are yet to be fully characterized and defined. The paucity of specific biomarkers and overlap in clinical presentations makes the distinction between these disease entities difficult at initial presentation and, as such, there is a heavy reliance on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings to satisfy the criteria for treatment initiation and optimization. Misdiagnosis is not uncommon and is usually related to the inaccurate application of criteria or failure to identify potential clinical and radiological mimics. It is also notable that there are instances where AQP4 and MOG antibody testing may be falsely negative during initial clinical episodes, further complicating the issue. This article illustrates the typical clinico-radiological phenotypes associated with the known pediatric RDS at presentation and describes the neuroimaging mimics of these using a pattern-based approach in the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord.

However, whether remyelination promotes motor recovery following demyelinating injury remains unclear. Damage to the internal capsule (IC) is known to result in motor impairment in multiple sclerosis and stroke. Here, we induced focal IC demyelination in mice by lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) injection, and examined its effect on motor behavior. We also compared the effect of LPC-induced IC damage to that produced by endothelin-1 (ET1), a potent vasoconstrictor used in experimental stroke lesions. We found that LPC or ET1 injections induced asymmetric motor deficit at 7\u00a0days post-lesion (dpl), and that both lesion types displayed increased microglia/macrophage density, myelin loss, and axonal dystrophy. The motor deficit and lesion pathology remained in ET1-injected mice at 28\u00a0dpl. In contrast, LPC-injected mice regained motor function by 28\u00a0dpl, with corresponding reduction in activated microglia/macrophage density, and recovery of myelin staining and axonal integrity in lesions. These results suggest that LPC-induced IC demyelination results in acute motor deficit and subsequent recovery through remyelination, and may be used to complement future drug screens to identify drugs for promoting remyelination.", "656": "Persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) are at an elevated risk of depression.

Myelin, a multilayer membranous that covers nerve fibers, is essential for rapid impulse conduction. Oligodendrocytes that are generated either from CNS-resident oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) or subventricular zone-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) are the myelinating cells of the CNS. The adult CNS maintains a certain endogenous potential to repair myelin damage. However, this process often fails as MS progresses. The origin of this failure is not fully understood, but it is likely to relate to progenitors/stem cells' arrestment in a quiescent state, incapable of generating new oligodendrocyte. Current treatments for MS are immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive medications, with little to no effect on myelin restoration. Recent studies have provided proof-of-principle that CNS remyelination can be promoted either via enhancing endogenous remyelination or by transplanting myelinating cells. Curcumin, a natural polyphenolic compound, has been shown to have therapeutic properties in several neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we investigated the effect of a curcumin nanoformulation, dendrosomal nanoparticles (DNC) on oligodendrogenesis and remyelination, both in vitro and in animal model of demyelination. We indicated that DNC enhanced oligodendrogenesis from NSCs and OPCs, in vitro in dose dependent manner. DNC also induced in vivo remyelination via promotion of oligodendrogenesis. Furthermore, DNC enhanced remyelination capacity of transplanted NSCs through promoting their survival and oligodendrogenesis capacity.

Many studies have suggested a possible role of metallic elements in the etiology of MS, but their concentration in the blood of MS patients is nonetheless little investigated in Brazil. In this work, these elements were studied through Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), whose analysis provides a tool to quantify the concentrations of metal elements in the blood samples of individuals with neurodegenerative disorders. This study aimed to compare the concentration of metallic elements in blood samples from patients with MS and healthy individuals. Blood was collected from 30 patients with multiple sclerosis and compared with the control group. Blood samples were digested in closed vessels using a microwave and ICP-MS was used to determine the concentrations of 12 metallic elements (Ba, Be, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mo, Ni, Pb and Zn). In MS patients, we observed a reduction in the concentrations of beryllium, copper, chromium, cobalt, nickel, magnesium and iron. The mean concentration of lead in blood was significantly elevated in the MS group. However, no difference was observed in the concentrations of Mo, Ba, Ca and Zn in blood samples from MS patients and the control group.

However, many approaches for engineering 3-D muscle bundles rely on specialized and time-consuming techniques, such as photolithography for fabrication and cryosectioning for histology. Cryosectioning also limits visualization to a single plane instead of the entire 3-D structure. To address these challenges, we first implemented a consumer-grade 3-D-printer to rapidly prototype multiple templates for engineering muscle bundles. We then employed our templates to engineer 3D muscle bundles and identify template geometries that promoted bundle survival over three weeks. Subsequently, we implemented tissue clearing, immunostaining, and confocal imaging to acquire z-stacks of intact muscle bundles labelled for myogenic markers. With this approach, we could select the imaging plane on-demand and visualize the intact 3-D structure of bundles.

Recently, DMF has been shown to exert a neuroprotective effect on the central nervous system (CNS), possibly through the modulation of microglia detrimental actions, observed also in multiple brain injuries. In addition to the hypothesis that DMF is linked to the activation of NRF2 and NF-kB transcription factors, the neuroprotective action of DMF may be mediated by the activation of the glutathione (GSH) antioxidant pathway and the regulation of brain iron homeostasis.

A major concern, however, is that GA treatment is associated with adverse effects and poor patient adherence due to the need for frequent injections. Here we describe improved performance of the polymeric drug, even at low doses with less-frequent injections, through the modification of its architecture into a star-shaped GA (sGA). In a sGA, multiple GAs are covalently linked onto a core, which greatly changes their properties such as molecular weight, size, and shape. The spherical sGA is retained longer in the body after intraperitoneal injection, and is more readily internalized by RAW 264.7 macrophage cells and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells than GA. In C57BL/6 mice induced with experimental autoimmune encephalitis, a mouse model for MS, sGA treatment exerts disease amelioration effect that is significantly better than that of GA despite a lower dose and less frequent injection. Moreover, spinal cord pathologies of demyelination and leukocyte infiltration are dramatically less pronounced in the sGA treatment condition compared to the GA treatment condition.

Localization of WM tracts associated with slowing, but not significant impairment, on specific cognitive tasks in pediatric and young age onset MS can facilitate early and effective therapeutic intervention. Diffusion tensor imaging data were collected on 25 MS patients and 24 controls who also underwent the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and the computer-based Cogstate simple and choice reaction time tests. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean (MD), radial (RD) and axial (AD) diffusivities were correlated voxel-wise with processing speed measures. All DTI metrics of several white matter tracts were significantly different between groups (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Notably, higher MD, RD, and AD, but not FA, in the corpus callosum correlated with lower scores on both SDMT and simple reaction time. Additionally, all diffusivity metrics in the left corticospinal tract correlated negatively with SDMT scores, whereas only MD in the right superior fronto-occipital fasciculus correlated with simple reaction time.

However, the role of P2X4 receptor in each pathology ranges from beneficial to detrimental, although the mechanisms are still mostly unknown. P2X4 is expressed at low levels in CNS cells including neurons and glial cells. In normal conditions, P2X4 activation contributes to synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. Importantly, one of the genes present in the transcriptional program of myeloid cell activation is P2X4.

It is therefore of great interest to investigate CXCR4/CXCR7/CXCL12 modulators in clinical development, with several CXCR4 and CXCL12 modulators such as plerixafor, ulocuplumab, balixafortide, and olaptesed pegol having already reached this stage. An overview is presented of the most important diseases whose outcomes can be positively or negatively regulated by the CXCR4/CXCR7-CXCL12 axis and summarizes preclinical and clinical data of modulators of that axis. Contrary to CXCR4 and CXCL12 modulators, CXCR7 modulators have, thus far, not been extensively studied. Therefore, more (pre)clinical investigations are needed.", "678": "No single neuroimaging technique or sequence is capable of reflecting the functional deficits manifest in MS. Given the interest in imaging biomarkers for short- to medium-term studies, we aimed to assess which imaging metrics might best represent functional impairment for monitoring in clinical trials. Given the complexity of functional impairment in MS, however, it is useful to isolate a particular functionally relevant pathway to understand the relationship between imaging and neurological function. We therefore analyzed existing data, combining multiparametric MRI and OCT to describe MS associated visual impairment. We assessed baseline data from fifty MS patients enrolled in ReBUILD, a prospective trial assessing the effect of a remyelinating drug (clemastine). Subjects underwent 3T MRI imaging, including Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI), myelin content quantification, and retinal imaging, using OCT. Visual function was assessed, using low-contrast letter acuity. MRI and OCT data were studied to model visual function in MS, using a partial, least-squares, regression analysis. Measures of neurodegeneration along the entire visual pathway, described most of the observed variance in visual disability, measured by low contrast letter acuity. In those patients with an identified history of ON, however, putative myelin measures also showed correlation with visual performance. In the absence of clinically identifiable inflammatory episodes, residual disability correlates with neurodegeneration, whereas after an identifiable exacerbation, putative measures of myelin content are additionally informative.", "679": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a neurological degenerative disease with high impact on our society. In order to mitigate its effects, proper rehabilitation therapy is mandatory, in which individualisation is a key factor. Technological solutions can provide the information required for this purpose, by monitoring patients and extracting relevant indicators. In this work, a novel Sensorized Tip is proposed for monitoring People with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) that require Assistive Devices for Walking (ADW) such as canes or crutches. The developed Sensorized Tip can be adapted to the personal ADW of each patient to reduce its impact, and provides sensor data while naturally walking in the everyday activities. This data that can be processed to obtain relevant indicators that helps assessing the status of the patient. Different from other approaches, a full validation of the proposed processing algorithms is carried out in this work, and a preliminary study-case is carried out with PwMS considering a set of indicators obtained from the Sensorized Tip's processed data. Results of the preliminary study-case demonstrate the potential of the device to monitor and characterise patient status.", "680": "Grounded theory qualitative approach.", "681": "To examine the genetic variability of Estonian Parkinson's disease (PD) patients using an ongoing epidemiological study in combination with a genetic analysis.", "682": "Unexpected stressful life events may alter immune function and affect susceptibility to autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS).

The BCG vaccine has other mechanisms of action besides tuberculosis protection, with immunomodulatory properties that are now being discovered. Reports have shown a significant protective effect against leprosy. Randomized controlled trials suggest that BCG vaccine has beneficial heterologous (nonspecific) effects on mortality in some developing countries. BCG immunotherapy is considered the gold standard adjuvant treatment for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. BCG vaccine has also been tested as treatment for diabetes and multiple sclerosis. Erythema of the BCG site is recognized as a clinical clue in Kawasaki disease. BCG administration in the immunodeficient patient is associated with local BCG disease (BCGitis) or disseminated BCG disease (BCGosis) with fatal consequences. BCG administration has been associated with the development of autoimmunity. We present a brief review of the diverse facets of the vaccine, with the discovery of its new modes of action providing new perspectives on this old, multifaceted and controversial vaccine.", "684": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most important paraclinical tool for assessing drug response in multiple sclerosis (MS) clinical trials. As such, MRI has also been widely used in preclinical research to investigate drug efficacy and pathogenic aspects in MS animal models. Keeping track of all published preclinical imaging studies, and possible new therapeutic approaches, has become difficult considering the abundance of studies. Moreover, comparisons between studies are hampered by methodological differences, especially since small differences in an MRI protocol can lead to large differences in tissue contrast. We therefore provide a comprehensive qualitative overview of preclinical MRI studies in the field of neuroinflammatory and demyelinating diseases, aiming to summarize experimental setup, MRI methodology, and risk of bias. We also provide estimates of the effects of tested therapeutic interventions by a meta-analysis. Finally, to improve the standardization of preclinical experiments, we propose guidelines on technical aspects of MRI and reporting that can serve as a framework for future preclinical studies using MRI in MS animal models. By implementing these guidelines, clinical translation of findings will be facilitated, and could possibly reduce experimental animal numbers.", "685": "Regulatory T cell (Treg)-based therapeutics are receiving increased attention for their potential to treat autoimmune disease and prevent transplant rejection. Adoptively transferred Tregs have shown promise in early clinical trials, but cell-based therapies are expensive and complex to implement, and \"off-the-shelf\" alternatives are needed. Here, we investigate the potential of artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPCs) fabricated from a blend of negatively charged biodegradable polymer (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), PLGA) and cationic biodegradable polymer (poly(beta-amino ester), PBAE) with incorporation of extracellular protein signals 1 and 2 and a soluble released signal 3 to convert na\u00efve T cells to induced Foxp3+ Treg-like suppressor cells (iTregs) both in vitro and in vivo in a biomimetic manner. The addition of PBAE to the aAPC core increased the conjugation efficiency of signal proteins to the particle surface and resulted in enhanced ability to bind to na\u00efve T cells and induce iTregs with potent suppressive function. Furthermore, PLGA/PBAE tolerogenic aAPCs (TolAPCs) supported the loading and sustained release of signal 3 cytokine TGF-\u03b2. A single dose of TolAPCs administered intravenously to C57BL/6\u00a0J mice resulted in an increased percentage of Foxp3+ cells in the lymph nodes. Thus, PLGA/PBAE TolAPCs show potential as an \"off-the-shelf\" biomimetic material for tolerance induction. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are promising for basic research and translational medicine as they can induce tolerance and have the potential to treat autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis. As cell-based therapies are expensive and difficult to manufacture and implement, non-cellular methods of engineering endogenous Tregs are needed. The research reported here describes a new type of biomimetic particle, tolerogenic artificial antigen presenting cells (TolAPCs) fabricated from a blend of negatively charged biodegradable polymer, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), and positively charged biodegradable polymer, poly(beta-amino ester), along with key biomolecular signals: extracellularly presented protein signals 1 and 2 and a soluble released signal 3. These TolAPCs bind to na\u00efve T cells and induce Foxp3+ Treg-like suppressor cells with potent suppressive function. In both in vitro and in vivo studies, it is shown that this non-cellular approach is useful to induce tolerance.", "686": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common chronic neurological disorder in young adults, with numerous potential effects on neurologic function. Sexual dysfunction (SD) is a common and very stressful one in persons with MS and represents a significant burden of disease. It has been shown that proportion of SD in MS is greater than in other neurological diseases, and almost five times higher than in the general population. Since there is no consistent definition in the literature for the diagnosis of SD, various studies reported a prevalence of SD of 40-80% in women and 50-90% in men with MS. The nature of sexual changes in this chronic illness is best defined as primary, secondary, and tertiary. Recently, it has been emphasized that detailed sexual history is crucial for all SD assessments and diagnoses. Committee 3 of the international consultation on sexual medicine suggested an updating algorithm for diagnostic evaluation of SD in both genders, with specific recommendations related to sexual history taking and diagnostic evaluation. Because treatments and preventive strategies might manage SD, it is necessary to increase the focus on these aspects of the disease when counselling patients. Management of SD should be comprehensive because the symptoms could be somatic, psychological, or related to relationship problems.", "687": "Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation have a role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and in depression. Fatigue is the most disabling symptom in patients with MS and could also be a part of depressive symptomatology. In this study, we measured the serum levels of uric acid (UA) as a marker of oxidative stress and C-reactive protein (CRP) as an inflammatory marker, in 98 patients with MS in relapse and remitting phase of illness and 35 healthy subjects. Degree of depressive symptomatology and fatigue were assessed with Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). Further, we examined the possible correlation of these biomarkers with symptoms of depression and fatigue. Relapse and remitting MS had a lower serum UA levels than controls (236.97\u2009\u00b1\u20099.25\u00a0\u00b5mol/L vs. 268.27\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09\u00a0\u00b5mol/L vs. 314.82\u2009\u00b1\u200911.02\u00a0\u00b5mol/L; p\u2009=\u20090.000), while sera levels of CRP were higher in relapse than remitting patients (4.46\u2009\u00b1\u20090.40\u00a0mg/L vs. 1.01\u2009\u00b1\u20090.38\u00a0mg/L; p\u2009=\u20090.000). Patients in relapse had higher BDI scores (15.68\u2009\u00b1\u200916.62 vs. 8.36\u2009\u00b1\u20097.10; p\u2009=\u20090.045). Decreased UA levels showed weak negative correlation with the presence of sadness and disturbed daily activities, higher CRP levels positively correlated with severe depression and the correlation between depression and fatigue was also observed (p\u2009<\u20090.05). It is possible that decreased UA levels lead to sadness, disturbed daily activities and severe disability. Every attack of CRP elevation in relapse could additionally precipitate the depression onset. The clinicians must pay special attention to early detection of fatigue because it could precede depression and improve further treatment.", "688": "The risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS) increases (OR: 3.1) after infectious mononucleosis (IM). However, the nature of this link is obscure. We tested the hypothesis that IM might incur long-term sequelae, including low-key inflammatory activity, with characteristics of an MS endophenotype (or presymptomatic trait) and that assays of MS-relevant cyto-/chemokines in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) post-IM may show a trend in this direction.", "689": "To examine the relationship between step-rate and energy expenditure during treadmill walking in persons with PD and then further develop a step-rate cut-point for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) for persons with PD.", "690": "The association of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) with multiple sclerosis (MS) is still widely unaddressed in larger, systematical clinical series. In this study, a cohort of Finnish MS patients was assessed regarding the incidence and prevalence of TN, as well as the presence of demyelinating lesions near the trigeminal ganglion, thus searching for a causative role of MS plaques in TN onset.", "691": "Axonal loss is the key pathological substrate of neurological disability in demyelinating disorders, including multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the consequences of demyelination on neuronal and axonal biology are poorly understood. The abundance of mitochondria in demyelinated axons in MS raises the possibility that increased mitochondrial content serves as a compensatory response to demyelination. Here, we show that upon demyelination mitochondria move from the neuronal cell body to the demyelinated axon, increasing axonal mitochondrial content, which we term the axonal response of mitochondria to demyelination (ARMD). However, following demyelination axons degenerate before the homeostatic ARMD reaches its peak. Enhancement of ARMD, by targeting mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial transport from the cell body to axon, protects acutely demyelinated axons from degeneration. To determine the relevance of ARMD to disease state, we examined MS autopsy tissue and found a positive correlation between mitochondrial content in demyelinated dorsal column axons and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) deficiency in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neuronal cell bodies. We experimentally demyelinated DRG neuron-specific complex IV deficient mice, as established disease models do not recapitulate complex IV deficiency in neurons, and found that these mice are able to demonstrate ARMD, despite the mitochondrial perturbation. Enhancement of mitochondrial dynamics in complex IV deficient neurons protects the axon upon demyelination. Consequently, increased mobilisation of mitochondria from the neuronal cell body to the axon is a novel neuroprotective strategy for the vulnerable, acutely demyelinated axon. We propose that promoting ARMD is likely to be a crucial preceding step for implementing potential regenerative strategies for demyelinating disorders.", "692": "So far, little is known about the properties of human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) in multiple sclerosis (MS). This type 4 glycoprotein belongs to a family of genes encoding proteins whose expression is associated with the process of spermatogenesis in the epididymis.

Overexpression of HE4 has been found in several malignant tumors, particularly in ovarian cancer, as well as in mesothelioma, lung, endometrial, breast, and kidney cancers.", "693": "The abnormal accumulation of neurotoxic proteins is the typical hallmark of various age-related neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Multiple sclerosis. The anomalous proteins, such as A\u03b2, Tau in Alzheimer's disease and \u03b1-synuclein in Parkinson's disease, perturb the neuronal physiology and cellular homeostasis in the brain thereby affecting the millions of human lives across the globe. Here, ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) plays a decisive role in clearing the toxic metabolites in cells, where any aberrancy is widely reported to exaggerate the neurodegenerative pathologies. In spite of well-advancement in the ubiquitination research, their molecular markers and mechanisms for target-specific protein ubiquitination and clearance remained elusive. Therefore, this review substantiates the role of UPS in the brain signaling and neuronal physiology with their mechanistic role in the NDD's specific pathogenic protein clearance. Moreover, current and future promising therapies are discussed to target UPS-mediated neurodegeneration for better public health.", "694": "Dermato-neuro syndrome is a potentially fatal neurological complication of scleromyxedema consisting of fever, seizures, and coma.

These progenitor cells were first discovered as bone marrow-derived adult multipotent cells and believed to migrate to sites of injury, opposing the notion that they are residents of all tissue types. In recent years, however, it has been demonstrated that MSC can be found in all tissues and MSC from different tissues represent distinct populations with differential protein expression unique to each tissue type. Importantly, these cells are efficient mediators of tissue repair, regeneration, and prove to be targets for therapeutics, demonstrated by clinical trials (<i>phase 1</i>-<i>4</i>) for MSC-derived therapies for diseases like graft-versus-host-disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn's disease. The tissue-resident status of MSC found in the lung is a key feature of their importance in the context of disease and injuries of the respiratory system, since these cells could be instrumental to providing more specific and targeted therapies. Currently, bone marrow-derived MSC have been established in the treatment of disease, including diseases of the lung. However, with lung-resident MSC representing a unique population with a different phenotypic and gene expression pattern than MSC derived from other tissues, their role in remediating lung inflammation and injury could provide enhanced efficacy over bone marrow-derived MSC methods. Through this review, lung-resident MSC will be characterized, using previously published data, by surface markers, gene expression patterns, and compared with bone-marrow MSC to highlight similarities and, importantly, differences in these cell types.", "696": "<i>Objectives</i>: Significantly elevated levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL) and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNfH) have been described in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the analytical performance of different neurofilament assays in a round robin with 10 centers across Europe/U.S. <i>Methods</i>: Serum, plasma and CSF samples from a group of five ALS and five neurological control patients were distributed across 10 international specialist neurochemical laboratories for analysis by a range of commercial and in-house neurofilament assays. The performance of all assays was evaluated for their ability to differentiate between the groups. The inter-assay coefficient of variation was calculated where appropriate from sample measurements performed across multiple laboratories using the same assay. <i>Results</i><b>:</b> All assays could differentiate ALS patients from controls in CSF. Inter-assay coefficient of variation of analytical platforms performed across multiple laboratories varied between 6.5% and 41.9%. <i>Conclusions</i><b>:</b> This study is encouraging for the growing momentum toward integration of neurofilament measurement into the specialized ALS clinic. It demonstrates the importance of 'round robin' studies necessary to ensure the analytical quality required for translation to the routine clinical setting.

Incidence rates from previous Russian studies ranged from 0.3 to 0.7 per 100,000/year. <i>Methods</i>: A retrospective study of the incidence of ALS was performed in the South district of Moscow (population, 1,760,000, 2015). Several data sources were investigated. The medical records of the calendar year 2015 were examined by an ALS expert who accepted only patients with definite or probable ALS according to the revised El Escorial criteria. Crude and standardized incidence rates were calculated, the latter adjusted to the Russian and the European population. <i>Results</i>: Twenty-two patients were found, accounting for a crude incidence of 1.25/100,000/year (95% CI 0.78-1.89) and a standardized incidence of 1.22 (Russia) and 1.28 (Europe). The sample included 11 men and 11 women aged 36-73 years (mean 56). Five patients (23%) had bulbar onset ALS.

Recognizing these impairments is crucial as they are associated with lower quality of life, shorter survival, and increased caregiver burden. Therefore, ALS-specific neuropsychological screening instruments have been developed that can account for motor and speech difficulties. This study provides an overview and comparison of these screeners. <i>Methods:</i> A systematic review was conducted using Medline and Embase. Articles describing cognitive/behavioral screening instruments assessed in ALS patients were included. Screening instruments were compared on multiple factors, such as domains, adaptability, required time, and validation. <i>Results:</i> We included 99 articles, reporting on nine cognitive screeners (i.e. ACE-R, ALS-BCA, ALS-CBS, ECAS, FAB, MMSE, MoCA, PSSFTS, and UCSF-SB), of which five ALS-specific. Furthermore, eight behavioral screeners (i.e. ALS-FTD-Q, AES, BBI, DAS, FBI, FrSBe, MiND-B, and NPI) were reported on, of which three ALS-specific. <i>Conclusion:</i> Considering the broad range of cognitive domains, adaptability, and satisfying validity, the ALS-CBS and ECAS appear to be the most suitable screeners to detect cognitive and behavioral changes in ALS. The BBI appears to be the best option to screen for behavioral changes in ALS, since all relevant domains are assessed, motor-related problems are considered, and has a satisfactory validity. The MiND-B and ALS-FTD-Q are promising as well. In general, all screening instruments would benefit from additional validation research to gain greater insights into test characteristics and to aid clinicians in selecting screening tools for use in clinical practice.", "699": "<i>Background and Objectives:</i> The corpus callosum is a site of pathological involvement in the neurodegenerative disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The corpus callosum shows widespread cortical connectivity topographically distributed along its length. Initial limb weakness in ALS is typically unilateral, becoming bilateral with disease progression. The precise anatomical substrate for this spread is uncertain. The present study investigated sub-regional variations in corpus callosum integrity in ALS, and whether these reflect a relationship with the development of unilateral or bilateral limb weakness. <i>Methods:</i> Sporadic ALS patients were categorized into unilateral (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200914) or bilateral (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200925) limb weakness at the time of assessment and underwent diffusion tensor imaging. Probabilistic bundle-specific tracking was carried out using MRtrix and TractSeg to parcellate the corpus callosum into seven anatomical segments (rostrum; genu; rostral body; anterior midbody; posterior midbody; isthmus; splenium). White matter tract integrity was assessed in all segments and compared with MRI data acquired from 25 healthy controls. <i>Results:</i> In the combined patient group, the most prominent differences in diffusivity metrics were in the rostral body, posterior midbody and isthmus of the corpus callosum (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.04). Loss of corpus callosum integrity was most prominent in the sub-group with unilateral limb weakness at the time of scanning (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05). <i>Conclusions:</i> Corpus callosum involvement in ALS is detectable across multiple segments, in keeping with a widespread cortical distribution of pathology. The association of unilateral limb weakness with greater loss of corpus callosum integrity informs connectivity-based hypotheses of symptom propagation in ALS.", "700": "The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) employs fixed cost-effectiveness (CE) thresholds that guide their appraisal of an intervention's long-term economic value. Given ICER's rising influence in the healthcare field, we undertook an assessment of the concordance of ICER's CE findings to the published CE findings from other research groups (i.e., \"non-ICER\" researchers including life science manufacturers, academics, and government institutions). Disease areas and pharmaceutical interventions for comparison were determined based on ICER evaluations conducted from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017. A targeted literature search was conducted for non-ICER CE publications using PubMed. Studies had to be conducted from the US setting, include the same disease characteristics (e.g., disease severity; treatment history), incorporate the same pharmaceutical interventions and comparison groups, and present incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained from the healthcare sector or payer perspective. Discordance was measured as the proportion of unique interventions that would have had more favorable valuations (i.e., low, intermediate, high value-for-money) if the CE findings from other research groups had been used for decision making instead of ICER's findings. More favorable valuations were defined as transitioning from low value (as determined by ICER) to intermediate or high value (as determined by other researchers) and from intermediate value (as determined by ICER) to high value (as determined by other researchers). Among the 13 non-ICER studies meeting inclusion criteria, six disease areas and 14 interventions were assessed. Of the 14 interventions, a more favorable valuation would have been recommended for ten therapies if the CE ratios from other research groups had been used for decision making instead of ICER's findings, representing a 71.4% (10/14) discordance rate. Moreover, these discrepancies were found in each of the evaluated disease areas, with the largest number of discordant valuations found in rheumatoid arthritis (five out of six interventions were discordant) followed by one valuation each in multiple sclerosis (one out of three), non-small cell lung cancer (one out of two), multiple myeloma (one out of one), high cholesterol (one out of one), and congestive heart failure (one out of one). Our findings indicate high discordance when comparing ICER's appraisals to the CE findings of non-ICER researchers.

The clinical application of the tissue sampling and imaging approaches to analyze apoptosis in neurological diseases is, however, limited. Since apoptotic bodies are membrane vesicles that are released from fragmented apoptotic cells, it follows that the presence of these vesicles in the bloodstream is likely due to the apoptotic death of cells in tissues.

Interconnecting multiple pathological mechanisms are involved in the neuropathology of this disease, including abnormal aggregation of proteins, neuroinflammation and dysregulation of the ubiquitin proteasome system. Such complex mechanisms, together with the lack of reliable animal models of the disease have hampered the development of drugs for this disease. Protein kinases, a key pharmacological target in several diseases, have been linked to ALS as they play a central role in the pathology of many diseases.

Several documented but not yet approved uses for modafinil have been described over the last 30\u00a0years, including alleviating fatigue in neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. Recent evidence has suggested that modafinil may have an immunomodulatory effect. Here, we review the different effects of modafinil treatment in animal models of brain inflammation and peripheral immune function. We conclude that there is unequivocal evidence of an anti-inflammatory effect of modafinil in experimental animal models of brain inflammation and neurodegenerative disorders, including systemic inflammation and methamphetamine-induced neuroinflammation, Parkinson's disease, brain ischemia, and multiple sclerosis. Modafinil acts on resident glial cells and infiltrating immune cells, negatively affecting both innate and adaptive immune responses in the brain. We also review the outcomes of modafinil treatment on peripheral immune function. The results of studies on this subject are still controversial and far from conclusive, but point to a new avenue of research in relation to peripheral inflammation. The data reviewed here raise the possibility of modafinil being used as adjuvant treatment for neurological disorders in which inflammation plays an important role.", "708": "5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) is an enzyme involved in arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism, a metabolic pathway in which cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) are the resultant metabolites. Both ALOX5 and CysLTs are clinically significant in a number of inflammatory diseases, such as in asthma and allergic rhinitis, and drugs antagonizing the effect of these molecules have long been successfully used to counter these diseases. Interestingly, recent advances in 'neuroinflammation' research has led to the discovery of several novel inflammatory pathways regulating many cerebral pathologies, including the ALOX5 pathway. By means of pharmacological and genetic studies, both ALOX5 and CysLTs receptors have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative/neurological diseases, such as in Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. In both transgenic and sporadic models of AD, it has been shown that the levels of ALOX5/CysLTs are elevated, and that genetic/pharmacological interventions of these molecules can alleviate AD-related behavioral and pathological conditions. Clinical relevance of these molecules has also been found in AD brain samples. In this review, we aim to summarize such important findings on the role of ALOX5/CysLTs in AD pathophysiology, from both the cellular and the molecular aspects, and also discuss the potential of their blockers as possible therapeutic choices to curb AD-related conditions.", "709": "We sought to investigate whether starting clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) for multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and elevated post-void residual (PVR) would improve urinary quality of life (QoL) and decrease risk of urinary tract infection (UTI).", "710": "Morphoea, also known as localized scleroderma, is a debilitating fibrosing disorder of uncertain aetiology, affecting the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Paediatric-onset disease is not uncommon and is associated with frequent relapses. The disease has complex pathogenetic mechanisms and multiple clinical subtypes, and affects children of all ages. Recent research has focused on elucidating the disease pathophysiology and identifying measures of disease activity. We performed a literature search on PubMed, MEDLINE and Google Scholar, using keywords such as 'pediatric morphea', 'juvenile localised scleroderma' and 'juvenile systemic sclerosis'. Relevant studies, including randomized trials, reviews of standard current guidelines and original research articles, were selected, and results were analysed before being summarized. In the first of this two-part review, we provide a bird's-eye view of the current literature concerning the epidemiology, aetiopathogenesis and clinical classification of paediatric morphoea; in Part 2, we review the diagnosis, markers of disease activity, management and natural history.", "711": "In multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), myeloid cells comprise a major part of the inflammatory infiltrate in the central nervous system (CNS). We previously described that motile sperm domain-containing protein 2 (MOSPD2) is expressed on human myeloid cells and regulates monocyte migration in vitro. The role of MOSPD2 in EAE pathogenesis was studied by generating MOSPD2 knock-out (KO) mice and monoclonal antibodies directed against MOSPD2. We found that EAE development in MOSPD2 KO mice was significantly suppressed. While frequency representation of leukocyte subsets in lymphoid tissues was comparable, the ratio of inflammatory monocytes in the blood was markedly reduced in MOSPD2 KO mice. In addition, T cells from MOSPD2 KO mice displayed reduced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and increased production of interleukin (IL)-4. Prophylactic and post-onset treatment using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) generated against MOSPD2 abrogated development and reduced EAE severity. These results suggest that MOSPD2 is key in regulating migration of inflammatory monocytes, and that anti-MOSPD2 mAbs constitute a potential therapy for the treatment of CNS inflammatory diseases.", "712": "To compare the effects of anodal trans-cranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) over primary motor and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices on Fatigue Severity Scale and its lasting effect on fatigue reduction and improvement in quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis.", "713": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a common cause of neurological disability among young adults and has a high economic burden. Currently there are 18 disease modifying agents for relapsing MS, which were tested in clinical trials versus placebo or an active comparator in a pairwise manner. However, there is currently no consensus on the fundamental principles of treatment approach and initial therapy selection. These factors result in variable use of disease modifying therapies. Here we describe the study protocol for Determining the Effectiveness of earLy Intensive Versus Escalation approaches for the Treatment of Relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis (DELIVER-MS). The main objective of the study is to determine whether an early highly effective treatment approach, defined as use of one of four monoclonal antibodies as initial therapy, is more effective than an escalation treatment approach (any other approved medication as initial therapy with subsequent escalation to higher efficacy treatments guided by radiological and clinical evaluation). The primary endpoint of the study is reduction in normalized brain volume loss from baseline visit to month 36 visit using MRI. Brain volume loss was selected as the best short-term predictor of long-term clinical disability.

Data were transcribed and analyzed thematically.<b>Results:</b> Sixteen severely impaired people with multiple sclerosis were interviewed (Expanded Disability Status Scale >6.5); aged 38-72\u2009years, nine female, time since diagnosis ranged 3-30\u2009years). Four key themes were generated in line with the study objectives, each with further sub-themes. The themes were (1) Definitions of isolation (2) Causes of isolation (3) Impact of isolation, and (4) Potential eases of isolation.<b>Conclusions:</b> Data portrayed social isolation as complex and multi-factorial in its definitions, its causes, and its impact. Isolation is not just about being lonely or left on one's own, but represents a spiral of impacts. Physical deterioration can lead to reduced choice and control regarding access to, and interaction with others and society, affecting personal identity. Sometimes this leads to further self-isolation. Personalised psychosocial support, with improved ease of access, focused on helping people with severe multiple sclerosis regain a sense of self and their place in the world may ease social isolation.Implications for rehabilitationPeople with severe multiple sclerosis can experience a sense of powerlessness, a lack of choice and control over daily life, leading to changes in self-identity and social isolation.Peoples' experiences are very personal, and any approach to help deal with social isolation needs to be based in considering how to think positively about how life can be lived and how to make that work.Multiple sclerosis support groups should not be assumed to alleviate feelings of social isolation.Interventions should focus on personalized psychosocial input aimed at helping the person with multiple sclerosis regain a sense of self and their place in the world.", "717": "Dysphagia in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with significant morbidity and has profound impact on the quality of life (QoL). This study aimed to analyze the dysphagia prevalence, attitudes, and dysphagia-related QoL in patients with MS, not at relapse. A prospective study of 108 consecutively recruited patients. The patients were asked to report dysphagia and completed a general dysphagia questionnaire (the Eating Assessment Tool-10, EAT-10), a disease-specific dysphagia questionnaire (the Dysphagia in Multiple Sclerosis, DYMUS), and a dysphagia-related QoL questionnaire (the Swallowing-Quality of Life). Twenty-six percent of the patients reported dysphagia. Many more were classified as dysphagic by the questionnaires (34.3% by EAT-10 and 44.4% by DYMUS). Overall, one out of four patients reported difficulties or choking while drinking fluids and eating food, cough related to eating, food sticking in the throat, need for food and drink segmentation, and repetitive swallows. The pleasure of eating was found to be moderately affected. The patients seem to cope well with the psychological and social impact of dysphagia. Serious consideration must be given to patients' perceptions and attitudes towards dysphagia. Our patients reported very little fear associated with their swallowing difficulties and choking. Apparently, they do not perceive the severity of their symptoms as an actual danger, as they have developed coping strategies. Dysphagia is common in MS patients not at relapse, even with mild disease-related impairment. Swallowing should be systematically assessed with validated questionnaires in all patients with MS at the course of the disease.", "718": "Methionine metabolism is dysregulated in multiple sclerosis (MS). The methyl donor betaine is depleted in the MS brain where it is linked to changes in levels of histone H3 trimethylated on lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and mitochondrial impairment. We investigated the effects of replacing this depleted betaine in the cuprizone mouse model of MS. Supplementation with betaine restored epigenetic control and alleviated neurological disability in cuprizone mice. Betaine increased the methylation potential (SAM/SAH ratio), levels of H3K4me3, enhanced neuronal respiration, and prevented axonal damage. We show that the methyl donor betaine and the betaine homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) enzyme can act in the nucleus to repair epigenetic control and activate neuroprotective transcriptional programmes. ChIP-seq data suggest that BHMT acts on chromatin to increase the SAM/SAH ratio and histone methyltransferase activity locally to increase H3K4me3 and activate gene expression\u00a0that supports neuronal energetics. These data suggest that the methyl donor betaine may provide neuroprotection in MS where mitochondrial impairment damages axons and causes disability.", "719": "Neurodegenerative disorders are a variety of diseases including Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's (PD), and Huntington's diseases (HD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) along with some other less common diseases generally described by the advanced deterioration of central or peripheral nervous system, structurally or functionally. In the last two decades, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) due to their unique assets encompassing self-renewal, multipotency and accessibility in association with low ethical concern open new frontiers in the context of neurodegenerative diseases therapy. Interestingly, MSCs can be differentiated into endodermal and ectodermal lineages (e.g., neurons, oligodendrocyte, and astrocyte), and thus could be employed to advance cell-based therapeutic strategy. Additionally, as inflammation ordinarily ensues as a local response provoked by microglia in the neurodegenerative diseases, MSCs therapy because of their pronounced immunomodulatory properties is noticed as a rational approach for their treatment. Recently, varied types of studies have been mostly carried out in vitro and rodent models using MSCs upon their procurement from various sources and expansion. The promising results of the studies in rodent models have motivated researchers to design and perform several clinical trials, with a speedily rising number.

Respiratory chain deficits in MS are proposed to metabolically compromise axon survival and remyelination by suppressing MCU activity. In support of this hypothesis, clinical scores, mitochondrial dysfunction, myelin loss, axon damage and inflammation were elevated while remyelination was blocked in neuronal MCU deficient (Thy1-MCU Def) mice relative to Thy1 controls subjected to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). At the first sign of walking deficits, mitochondria in EAE/Thy1 axons showed signs of activation. By contrast, cytoskeletal damage, fragmented mitochondria and large autophagosomes were seen in EAE/Thy1-MCU Def axons. As EAE severity increased, EAE/Thy1 axons were filled with massively swollen mitochondria with damaged cristae while EAE/Thy1-MCU Def axons were riddled with late autophagosomes. ATP concentrations and mitochondrial gene expression were suppressed while calpain activity, autophagy-related gene mRNA levels and autophagosome marker (LC3) co-localization in Thy1-expressing neurons were elevated in the spinal cords of EAE/Thy1-MCU Def compared to EAE/Thy1 mice. These findings suggest that MCU inhibition contributes to axonal damage that drives MS progression.", "728": "The pathophysiological relevance of the endocannabinoid system has been widely demonstrated in a variety of diseases including cancer, neurological disorders, and metabolic issues.

The retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors \u03b3t (ROR\u03b3t) have an indispensable effect on the differentiation of this cell type, and are thus considered a valuable target in the treatment of Th17-related disorders. In this study, we found that eriodictyol (EDT), a natural flavonoid abundant in citrus fruits and peanuts, was located directly in the binding pocket of ROR\u03b3t, and induced a conformational change that resulted in the effective suppression of the receptor's activity, thus offering insight into the transcriptional inhibition of ROR\u03b3t-dependent genes. Consistent with this, EDT dose-dependently (5-10 \u03bcM) blocked murine Th17 differentiation, and markedly reduced IL-17A secretion in vitro. Furthermore, this compound has been found to have novel properties for directly inhibiting Th1 cell development and promoting Treg cell differentiation at high doses (\u226510 \u03bcM). EDT administration significantly decreased the clinical severity in the EAE model, with inhibited demyelination and reduced inflammatory responses in the periphery and in the central nervous system (CNS). In the adoptive transfer model, EDT also remarkably suppressed the Th17 cell infiltration and pathogenicity. Collectively, our data demonstrated that EDT, as an agent for the pharmacological inhibition of ROR\u03b3t, has great potential for immunomodulation, and for use in the treatment of Th17-mediated autoimmune disease.", "742": "Oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells in the vertebrate central nervous system, produce myelin sheaths to enable saltatory propagation of action potentials. The process of oligodendrocyte myelination entails a stepwise progression from precursor specification to differentiation, which is coordinated by a series of transcriptional and chromatin remodeling events. ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes, which utilize ATP as an energy source to control chromatin dynamics and regulate the accessibility of chromatin to transcriptional regulators, are critical for oligodendrocyte lineage development and regeneration. In this review, we focus on the latest insights into the spatial and temporal specificity of chromatin remodelers during oligodendrocyte development, myelinogenesis, and regeneration. We will also bring together various plausible mechanisms by which lineage specific transcriptional regulators coordinate with chromatin remodeling factors for programming genomic landscapes to specifically modulate these different processes during developmental myelination and remyelination upon injury.", "743": "DNA methylation is one of many epigenetic marks, which directly modifies base residues, usually cytosines, in a multiple-step cycle.

We here review the role of DNA methylation in Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming glia of the peripheral and central nervous systems, respectively. We first address how methylation and demethylation are regulating myelinating cells' differentiation during development and repair. We then mention how DNA methylation dysregulation in diseases and cancers could explain their pathogenesis by directly influencing myelinating cells' proliferation and differentiation capacities.", "744": "Sequence analyses highlight a massive peptide sharing between immunoreactive Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) epitopes and human proteins that-when mutated, deficient or improperly functioning-associate with tumorigenesis, diabetes, lupus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and immunodeficiencies, among others.

Here, through targeted-metabololipidomics in peripheral blood of patients with MS, we revealed that each disease form was associated with distinct LM profiles that significantly correlated with disease severity. In particular, relapsing and progressive MS patients were associated with high eicosanoids levels, whereas the majority of pro-resolving LM were significantly reduced or below limits of detection and correlated with disease progression. Furthermore, we found impaired expression of several pro-resolving LM biosynthetic enzymes and receptors in blood-derived leukocytes of MS patients. Mechanistically, differentially expressed mediators like LXA<sub>4</sub>, LXB<sub>4</sub>, RvD1 and PD1 reduced MS-derived monocyte activation and cytokine production, and inhibited inflammation-induced blood-brain barrier dysfunction and monocyte transendothelial migration. Altogether, these findings reveal peripheral defects in the resolution pathway in MS, suggesting pro-resolving LM as novel diagnostic biomarkers and potentially safe therapeutics.", "746": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated neurodegenerative disease of the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord. Among persons with MS, 30% experience significant mobility impairment that requires use of a wheelchair for mobility. Exercise is an evidence-based second-line therapy that can improve mobility; however, little research has focused on individuals that use wheelchairs for mobility. Framed by social cognitive theory (SCT), we conducted a formative qualitative study examining exercise status and perceptions among 20 persons with MS who use wheelchairs for mobility. Using deductive, semantic thematic analysis, we coded for SCT variables (i.e. self-efficacy, knowledge, outcome expectations, barriers and facilitators) and identified participants as regular or inconsistent exercisers. In total, 12 participants were classified as regular exercisers and 8 inconsistent exercisers. Regular exercisers more frequently reported high self-efficacy, consistent exercise knowledge and numerous facilitators. All participants reported some positive outcome expectations and several barriers and facilitators. These findings can inform future intervention studies supporting exercise behavior change through SCT. Strategies such as increasing self-efficacy, imparting instructional materials, shaping realistic outcome expectations and providing tools directed toward overcoming barriers and identifying facilitators may work to support the exercise endeavor of persons with MS who use wheelchairs for mobility.", "747": "Graph theory and network modelling have been previously applied to characterize motor network structural topology in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, between-group differences disclosed by graph analysis might be primarily driven by discrepancy in density, which is likely to be reduced in pathologic conditions as a consequence of macroscopic damage and fibre loss that may result in less streamlines properly traced. In this work, we employed the convex optimization modelling for microstructure informed tractography (COMMIT) framework, which, given a tractogram, estimates the actual contribution (or weight) of each streamline in order to optimally explain the diffusion magnetic resonance imaging signal, filtering out those that are implausible or not necessary. Then, we analysed the topology of this 'COMMIT-weighted sensory-motor network' in MS accounting for network density. By comparing with standard connectivity analysis, we also tested if abnormalities in network topology are still identifiable when focusing on more 'quantitative' network properties. We found that topology differences identified with standard tractography in MS seem to be mainly driven by density, which, in turn, is strongly influenced by the presence of lesions. We were able to identify a significant difference in density but also in network global and local properties when accounting for density discrepancy. Therefore, we believe that COMMIT may help characterize the structural organization in pathological conditions, allowing a fair comparison of connectomes which considers discrepancies in network density. Moreover, discrepancy-corrected network properties are clinically meaningful and may help guide prognosis assessment and treatment choice.", "748": "Chronic neurological disorders (CND's) are lifelong diseases and cannot be eradicated, but their severe effects can be alleviated by early preemptive measures. CND's, such as Alzheimer's, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), are the chronic ailment of the central nervous system that causes the degradation of emotional and cognitive abilities. Long term continuous monitoring with neuro-feedback of human emotions for patients with CND's is crucial in mitigating its harmful effect. This paper presents hardware efficient and dedicated human emotion classification processor for CND's. Scalp EEG is used for the emotion's classification using the valence and arousal scales. A linear support vector machine classifier is used with power spectral density, logarithmic interhemispheric power spectral ratio, and the interhemispheric power spectral difference of eight EEG channel locations suitable for a wearable non-invasive classification system. A look-up-table based logarithmic division unit (LDU) is to represent the division features in machine learning (ML) applications. The implemented LDU minimizes the cost of integer division by 34% for ML applications. The implemented emotion's classification processor achieved an accuracy of 72.96% and 73.14%, respectively, for the valence and arousal classification on multiple publicly available datasets.

This makes diagnosing patients difficult, imperative to initiating early and proper treatment. Several common features exist, among them a profound infiltration of monocytes into the CNS mediating demyelination and tissue destruction. In the periphery, monocytes are divided into three subsets depending on expression of CD14 and CD16, representing different stages of activation and differentiation. To investigate their involvement in MS, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 61 patients with incipient, untreated MS and 22 symptomatic control (SC) patients as well as 6 patients with radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) were characterized ex vivo. In addition, paired serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were analyzed with a panel of biomarkers. In PBMC samples, we demonstrate decreased levels of nonclassical monocytes with a concomitant significant decrease of human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) H3 envelope epitopes on this monocyte subset compared with SC and RIS. The observed HERV expression is present on nonclassical monocytes irrespective of MS and thus presumably a result of the inflammatory activation. For the other surface markers analyzed, we found significantly decreased expression between classical and nonclassical monocytes. In matched samples of CSF a highly significant increase in levels of soluble markers of activation and inflammation is shown, and notably this is not the case for the serum samples. Of the soluble markers investigated, interleukin (IL)-12/IL-23p40 had the highest discriminatory power in differentiating patients with MS from SC and RIS, almost comparable to the immunoglobulin G index.", "750": "There is ongoing debate on how B cells contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). The success of B-cell targeting therapies in MS highlighted the role of B cells, particularly the antibody-independent functions of these cells such as antigen presentation to T cells and modulation of the function of T cells and myeloid cells by secreting pathogenic and/or protective cytokines in the central nervous system. Here, we discuss the role of different antibody-dependent and antibody-independent functions of B cells in MS disease activity and progression proposing new therapeutic strategies for the optimization of B-cell targeting treatments.", "751": "Neuroinflammation is a key aspect of various injuries and diseases of the central nervous system and brain, including stroke, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, etc. Phoenixin-14 is a naturally occurring pleiotropic peptide involved in reproduction, anxiety, pain, and other functions.", "752": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is induced by variety of factors and eventually causes multiple organ damage. In recent years, biological agents targeting cytokines and cell surface molecules have gradually come to market. Here, the anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects of a novel bispecific antibody (FL-BsAb1/17) targeting interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) were detected. Bleomycin (BLM) was subcutaneously injected for 21 consecutive days to establish the SSc mouse model, and mice were subsequently treated with etanercept or different doses (1, 5, 10\u00a0mg/kg) of FL-BsAb1/17. The results showed that FL-BsAb1/17 treatment (10\u00a0mg/kg, 5\u00a0mg/kg) significantly attenuated BLM-induced SSc-like inflammation by inhibiting the expression of inflammatory factors (IL-17A, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, IL-22, IL-23, IL-6) and fibrosis, with specific outcomes of dermis thickening and lung fibrosis, by inhibiting the expression of fibrotic factors (TGF-\u03b2, \u03b1-sma, Col-1, Col-3) in the serum, skin and lungs. In addition, FL-BsAb1/17 (10\u00a0mg/kg, 5\u00a0mg/kg) downregulated protein levels of TGF-\u03b2 and phosphorylated Smad2/3 in the skin and lungs and reduced collagen 1 protein levels. This indicated that FL-BsAb1/17 can inhibit the development of fibrosis by inhibiting the TGF-\u03b2/Smad2/3 signaling pathway. FL-BsAb1/17 (10\u00a0mg/kg, 5\u00a0mg/kg) could also effectively reduce the content of MDA, increase the activity of SOD and CAT, and improve the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC). In conclusion, FL-BsAb1/17 alleviated BLM-induced SSc by downregulating inflammatory cascades, relieving oxidative stress and inhibiting TGF-\u03b2/Smad2/3 signaling.

C57BL/6 mice were divided into three experimental groups (n\u00a0=\u00a010/group): (a) Control; (b) EAE; (c) EAE\u00a0+\u00a0sild (25\u00a0mg/kg/21\u00a0days). Sildenafil was able to delay the onset and attenuate the severity of the clinical symptoms of EAE. The drug also reduced the infiltration of CD4+ T lymphocytes and their respective IL-17 and TNF-\u03b1 cytokines. Moreover, sildenafil reduced neuroinflammation in the hippocampus (assessed by the reduction of inflammatory markers IL-1\u03b2, pIKB\u03b1 and pNFkB and reactive gliosis, as well as elevating the inhibitory cytokines TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10). Moreover, sildenafil induced increased levels of NeuN, BDNF and pCREB, protein kinases (PKA, PKG, and pERK) and synaptophysin, and modulated the expression of the glutamate receptors AMPA and NMDA. The present findings demonstrated that sildenafil has therapeutic potential for cognitive deficit associated with multiple sclerosis.", "754": "<b>Purpose of the study</b><b>:</b> Multiple sclerosis is a CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell mediated autoimmune disease characterized by inflammatory demyelination in the central nervous system. Acetylcholine (ACh) has been reported to be released by T lymphocytes and plays as an inflammation and immune regulator through the participation of T cells. However, both attenuated and aggravated effects of ACh in inflammation were found. The aim of this study is to further investigate the role of ACh in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).<b>Materials and methods:</b> The left cervical vagotomy was performed to inhibit ACh release with the sham-operation as control. ACh in cerebral cortex and splenocytes culture supernatants of EAE mice were determined. Interleukin-6, interferon-\u03b3, interleukin-4 and interleukin-17A in brain and splenocytes culture supernatants were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and subsets were assessed by flow cytometry.<b>Results:</b> Compared with the sham-operation group, improved clinical and pathological parameters as well as decreased interleukin-6, interferon-\u03b3, interleukin-4 and interleukin-17A were found in EAE mice with vagotomy suppressing the ACh. Marked reductions of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup>ChAT<sup>+</sup> cells, as well as significant decrease in Th1 with a bias to Th2 in Th1/Th2 balance and increased ChAT<sup>+</sup>Th2 proportion in the spleen were also observed in vagotomized mice.<b>Conclusions:</b> These findings emphasize that inhibiting ACh release by vagotomy can ameliorate the exacerbation of EAE through suppressing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells proliferation and regulating the differentiation of Th1, Th2 and Th17.", "755": "The modified Story Memory Technique (mSMT) is a memory rehabilitation program that combines training in visualization and context formation to improve learning and memory. Previous studies have shown improvement in learning and memory in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) after undergoing the mSMT, including changes in brain activity related to working memory and word encoding. The current study examined changes in brain activity in 16 individuals diagnosed with MS (n <sub>treatment</sub>\u202f=\u202f6; n <sub>placebo control</sub>\u202f=\u202f10) when they were presented with to-be-remembered information within a meaningful context (i.e. a paragraph) from before to after mSMT treatment. We expected treatment-related changes in brain activation in the language network (LAN), default mode network (DMN), and executive control network (ECN). Consistent with this prediction, fMRI results revealed reduced brain activation in the LAN, DMN and ECN after completing the mSMT treatment in the context of paragraph learning. While no significant behavioral changes were observed, a marginally significant improvement with a large effect size was noted between baseline and follow-up performance on the Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test in persons who completed treatment.

Cognitive rehabilitation and exercise training have been identified as promising behavioral approaches for managing MS-related cognitive impairment based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses. However, each body of literature is associated with similar sets of methodological shortcomings, as has been identified by periodic systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Thus, there is little generalizability or transportability research supporting either behavioral approach for managing cognitive dysfunction in this population under real-world conditions (i.e., as a standard-of-care). To that end, this paper aims to catalyze the advancement of cognitive rehabilitation and exercise training research in MS, respectively, towards the successful implementation of generalizability/transportability trials. This first involves critical examinations of the respective cognitive rehabilitation and exercise training literatures in MS from a chronological perspective, with particular emphasis on how the fields have each evolved in response to systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Accordingly, the current paper then provides a roadmap for harmonizing research in those areas to systematically and efficiently inform the development of generalizability/transportability trials for behavioral approaches to manage MS-related cognitive dysfunction. This involves the recognition of overlapping facilitators and impediments for progress in each field, including considerations for the implementation of neuroimaging.

The progressive nature suggests that people will not be able to live a normal productive life and will gradually require public benefits to maintain living standards. This study investigates the public economic impact of MS and how investments in disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) influence the lifetime costs to government attributed to changes in lifetime tax revenue and disability benefits based on improved health status linked to delayed disease progression.<b>Methods:</b> Disease progression rates from previous MS Markov cohort models were applied to interferon beta-1a, peginterferon beta-1a, dimethyl fumarate, and natalizumab using a public economic framework. The established relationship between expanded disability status scale and work-force participation, annual earnings, and disability rates for each DMT were applied. Subsequently, we assessed the effect of DMTs on discounted governmental costs consisting of health service costs, social insurance and disability costs, and changes in lifetime tax revenues.<b>Results:</b> Fiscal benefits attributed to informal care and community services savings for interferon beta-1a, peginterferon beta-1a, dimethyl fumarate, and natalizumab were SEK340,387, SEK486,837, SEK257,330, and SEK958,852 compared to placebo, respectively.

The primary cohort included patients who had prescribed annual dosing visits indicated by the approved product label (PL): 3 OCR, 5 ATZ, and 12-13 NTZ infusion visits within the first year of initiation. Annual treatment cost was the sum of all costs on index DMT infusion visit dates. Costs were summarized for a primary and secondary cohort of patients receiving additional doses than prescribed in PL (>3 OCR, >5 ATZ, and >13 NTZ infusion visits); and an overall cohort of patients who met minimum required annual dose (\u22653 OCR, \u22655 ATZ, and \u226512 NTZ), further stratified by insurance type.<b>Results:</b> For patients in the primary cohort (123 OCR, 18 ATZ, and 48 NTZ), mean (standard-deviation) annual cost of treatment with OCR, ATZ, and NTZ cohorts was $72,066 ($34,480), $121,053 ($51,097) and $93,777 ($38,815), respectively.

Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a severe autoimmune disease of the CNS with similar prevalence features to MS and has recently been considered a different entity from MS. Measuring ovarian reserve is one way of evaluating fertility. Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) is a peptide hormone produced by ovarian granulosa cells of early follicles and is considered to be a marker for ovarian reserve. With MS and NMOSD predominance in young women, the present study aimed to address the possibility of these diseases affecting fertility by measuring AMH levels in MS and NMOSD patients and comparing it with healthy controls. The present study included 23 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients, 23 seronegative NMOSD patients, and 23 healthy age-matched controls between 18 and 45\u00a0years of age. Serum samples of the three groups were collected, and the AMH levels were measured with AMH Gen II Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, Beckman Coulter kit. In the present study, the AMH levels did not differ significantly between the groups (p\u2009=\u20090.996). The mean AMH in the RRMS group was 3.59\u2009\u00b1\u20090.55\u00a0ng/ml compared with the mean of 3.60\u2009\u00b1\u20090.50\u00a0ng/ml in healthy controls. The mean AMH levels in the NMOSD group were 3.66\u2009\u00b1\u20090.61\u00a0ng/ml. Lower levels of AMH were found to be negatively associated with annualized relapse rate (in both groups of patients) and MS severity score. However, the difference was not significant. In NMOSD patients, the serum levels of AMH were negatively associated with disease duration (r\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.42, p\u2009=\u20090.023).

No difference was found in the expression of other miRNAs between study subgroups. In addition, there was no significant difference in the expression of any miRNA between responders and non-responders. Although there were significant pairwise correlations between expression levels of all of the assessed miRNAs in controls, MS patients exhibited differences in correlation patterns. Expression of miR-381-3p was correlated with age in responders. However, expression of other miRNAs did not correlate with age in any study subgroup. The current study indicates a possible role for miR-655-3p and miR-381-3p in the pathogenesis of MS or possible effects of fingolimod on the expression of these miRNAs.

Previously, it has been demonstrated that short-chain fatty acids reduce inflammation in the central nervous system in a murine model of multiple sclerosis through an increase in tissue infiltrating Tregs. Here, we evaluated the effect of the short-chain fatty acid propionate on the chronic inflammatory state and T-cell composition in ESRD patients. Analyzing ESRD patients and healthy blood donors before, during, and 60\u00a0days after the propionate supplementation by multiparametric flow cytometry we observed a gradual and significant expansion in the frequencies of CD25<sup>high</sup>CD127<sup>-</sup> Tregs in both groups. Phenotypic characterization suggests that polarization of na\u00efve T cells towards Tregs is responsible for the observed expansion. In line with this, we observed a significant reduction of inflammatory marker CRP under propionate supplementation. Of interest, the observed anti-inflammatory surroundings did not affect the protective pathogen-specific immunity as demonstrated by the stable frequencies of effector/memory T cells specific for tetanus/diphtheria recall antigens. Collectively, our data suggest that dietary supplements with propionate have a beneficial effect on the elevated systemic inflammation of ESRD patients.

Therefore, this work aimed to explore the association between fatigue and brain energy status. Thirty MS patients with progressive disease forms completed the study. Their sociodemographic and clinical data including fatigue and disability scores [i.e., Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)] were collected. <sup>31</sup>P-MRS spectra of (1) bilateral frontoparietal area and (2) centrum semiovale normal\u00a0appearing white matter (NAWM) were obtained.

FSS scores were found to be directly correlated with the frontoparietal \u03b2-ATP % (p\u2009<\u20090.05). However, there were no significant correlations between FSS scores and NAWM energy metabolites or clinical data (i.e., age, EDSS scores or disease duration). These findings point toward the existence of a link between fatigue severity and the amount of cerebral ATP metabolites. Such a link might reflect either a high production or low utilization of ATP, both of which were\u00a0paralleled with increased fatigue perception. While the former would be due to a redistribution of ion channels along demyelinated axons and subsequent changes in mitochondrial activity; the latter could be interpreted in the light of neuronal loss which would lead to a decrease in ATP utilization and accumulation of its metabolites.", "773": "The possible role of oxidative stress and nitric oxide (NO) in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) has been suggested by several neuropathological, biochemical, and experimental data.

This assessor-blinded, randomized crossover study included 26 PwMS, 16 females, mean age 47.9 and median EDSS score 4.5. Participants attended two sessions: SVT and control training. Exercises for both the SVT and control sessions were based on ball-catching tasks. Training sessions were identical in length (40-50\u00a0min) and type of exercise drills. The difference between the two practice regimes was that the SVT session was performed wearing stroboscopic glasses and the control training was performed with similar glasses without lenses.

Nineteen persons with MS and 17 healthy controls underwent fMRI scanning while performing a modified version of the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, which consisted of high and low cognitive load conditions with comparable visual stimulation. State mental fatigue was assessed using the Visual Analog Scale of Fatigue before and after each run of the behavioral task. Results indicated that the healthy control group recruited significantly more anterior brain regions (superior and middle frontal gyri, insula, and superior temporal gyrus) to meet increased task demands during the high cognitive load condition as fatigue level increased (p\u2009<\u20090.05), which was accompanied by shorter response time.

Indeed, the MS group continued to activate more posterior brain regions (precuneus, lingual gyrus, and middle occipital gyrus) for the high cognitive load condition (p\u2009<\u20090.05) with no improvement in speed. In conclusion, persons with MS may allocate neural resources less efficiently than healthy controls when faced with increased task demands, which may result in increased mental fatigue.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure serum pNfH concentration in 219 MND patients consecutively enrolled in our tertiary MND clinic. A multifactorial analysis was carried out to investigate the major clinical determinants of serum pNfH. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression analysis were performed to explore the prognostic value of serum pNfH. Serum pNfH levels were not homogenous among MND phenotypes; higher concentrations in pyramidal, bulbar, and classic phenotypes were observed. C9orf72-MND exhibited higher pNfH concentrations compared to non-C9orf72 MND. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed mean MEP/cMAP and disease progression rate as the two major predictors of serum pNfH levels (R<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.188; p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001).

Our study evidenced that higher serum pNfH concentration is a negative independent prognostic factor for survival. In Cox multivariate model, pNfH concentration showed the highest hazard ratio compared to the other factors influencing survival included in the analysis. pNfH differs among the MND phenotypes and is an independent prognostic factor for survival. This study provides supporting evidence of the role of pNfH as useful prognostic biomarker for MND patients.

Our study further revealed that the activation of GPR120 by \u03c9-3 FAs can result in a decrease of phosphorylated transforming growth factor-\u03b2 activated kinase 1 (TAK1), and further inhibit the downstream IKK\u03b2/I-\u03baB pathway and the terminal NF-\u03baB activation which serves as a mediator of T cell activation. \u03c9-3 Fatty acids exhibited an inhibitory effect on TAK1 by enhancing the association of \u03b2-arrestin2 and TAK1 binding protein 1 (TAB1), thus the disassociation of TAB1 from the TAB1/TAK1 complex renders a limited effect on \u03b2-arrestin2 signaling as an innate immunity regulation.

Here we performed proteomic analysis of OPCs freshly isolated from the brains of neonate, young and aged female rats. Approximately 50% of the proteins are expressed at different levels in OPCs from neonates compared with their adult counterparts. The amount of myelin-associated proteins, and proteins associated with oxidative phosphorylation, inflammatory responses and actin cytoskeletal organization increased with age, whereas cholesterol-biosynthesis, transcription factors and cell cycle proteins decreased.

Recent studies suggested that ATRA displays multiple neuroprotective effects and thereby alleviates the disease progression in a variety of neurological diseases. Our previous studies found that the impaired retinoic acid signal decreased ALDH1A2, an essential synthetase of ATRA, in the spinal cord of ALS mice. Here, we evaluated the neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects of ATRA in a SOD1-G93A transgenic mice model of ALS. We administrated ATRA(3\u00a0mg/kg) daily from the onset stage to the progression stage for 5\u00a0weeks. Behavioral tests showed that ATRA improved the forelimb grip strength in ALS mice and may slow the disease progression, but not the body weight. ATRA could completely reverse the impaired retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR\u03b1) signal in the spinal cord of ALS mice. This effect was accompanied by enhancing the degradation of misfolded proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, regulating the oxidative stress, inhibiting the astrocyte activation, and promoting the neurotrophic signal recovery. Our findings are the first to indicate that the damaged retinoic acid signal is involved in the pathogenesis of ALS, and ATRA could induce the functional neuroprotection via repairing the damaged retinoic acid signal.", "803": "Cathepsins are a family of lysosomal/endosomal proteolytic enzymes that include serine, aspartate, and cysteine proteases. The role of cathepsin in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, remains elusive.

Quantitative real-time PCR results and Western blotting analyses revealed that serine, aspartate, and cysteine cathepsins are expressed at significantly higher levels in the olfactory bulbs of mice with EAE in the paralytic stage compared with those of control mice. Immunohistochemical analyses indicated that cathepsin A, D, and S were expressed in the glomerulus layer, external plexiform layer, and mitral cell layer. Furthermore, cathepsins were detected in astrocytes, microglia, inflammatory cells, and vascular cells in the olfactory bulb of EAE mice at the paralytic stage. Collectively, these results suggest that the upregulation of cathepsins in the olfactory bulb of mice with EAE is associated with transient olfactory dysfunction in autoimmune encephalomyelitis.", "804": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory, and neurodegenerative autoimmune disease. MS is a devastating disorder that is characterized by cognitive and motor deficits. Cuprizone-induced demyelination is the most widely experimental model used for MS.

Secukinumab (SEC) is a fully human monoclonal anti-human antibody of the IgG1/kappa isotype that selectively targets IL-17A. Expression of IL-17 is associated with MS. Also, IL-17 stimulates microglia and astrocytes resulting in progression of MS through chemokine production and neutrophil recruitment. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of SEC on cuprizone-induced demyelination with examining the underlying mechanisms. Locomotor activity, short-term spatial memory function, staining by Luxol Fast Blue, myelin basic protein, gliasosis, inflammatory, and oxidative-stress markers were assessed to evaluate neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.

Here, we will review genetic as well as experimental evidence that suggest that non-neuronal cells are at least partially driving disease pathogenesis in numerous neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease.", "856": "The number of disease-modifying treatments (DMDs) for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis has increased. DMDs differ not only in their efficacy and safety/tolerability, but also in the treatment burden of, associated with their initiation, route/frequency of administration, maintenance treatment and monitoring. High-efficacy DMDs bring the prospect of improved suppression of relapses and progression of disability, but may have serious safety issues, and burdensome long-term monitoring. Studies of patient preferences in this area have focused on side effects, efficacy and route of administration. Adherence to DMDs is often suboptimal in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and there is a need to understand more about how the complex therapeutic and administration profiles of newer DMDs interact with these barriers to support optimal adherence to therapy.", "857": "In developed countries, multiple sclerosis (MS) is the leading cause of non-traumatic neurological disability in young adults. MS is a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, in which myelin is attacked, changing white matter structure and leaving lesions. The demyelination has a direct effect on white matter conductivity. This effect can be examined in the visual system, where damage is highly prevalent in MS, leading to substantial delays in conduction, commonly measured with visual evoked potentials (VEPs). The structural damage to the visual system in MS is often estimated with MRI measurements in the white matter. Recent developments in quantitative MRI (qMRI) provide improved sensitivity to myelin content and new structural methods allow better modeling of the axonal structure, leading researchers to link white matter microstructure to conduction properties of action potentials along fiber tracts. This study attempts to explain the variance in conduction latencies down the visual pathway using structural measurements of both the retina and the optic radiation (OR). Forty-eight progressive MS patients, participants in a longitudinal stem-cell therapy clinical trial, were included in this study, three and six months post final treatment. Twenty-seven patients had no history of optic neuritis, and were the main focus of this study. All participants underwent conventional MRI scans, as well as diffusion MRI and qMRI sequences to account for white matter microstructure. Optical coherence tomography scans were also obtained, and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness and macular volume measurements were extracted. Finally, latencies of recorded VEPs were estimated. Our results show that in non-optic neuritis progressive MS patients there is a relationship between the VEP latency and both retinal damage and OR lesion load. In addition, we find that qMRI values, sampled along the OR, are also correlated with VEP latency. Finally, we show that combining these parameters using PCA we can explain more than 40% of the inter-subject variance in VEP latency. In conclusion, this study contributes to understanding the relationship between the structural properties and conduction in the visual system in disease. We focus on the visual system, where the conduction latencies can be estimated, but the conclusions could be generalized\u00a0to other brain systems where the white matter structure can be measured. It also highlights the importance of having multiple parameters when assessing the clinical stages of MS patients, which could have major implications for future studies of other white matter diseases.", "858": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease with no cure; however, symptomatic management has an impact on quality of life and survival. Symptom management is best performed in a multidisciplinary care setting, where patients are evaluated by multiple health care professionals.

Particular vigilance has been warranted regarding the continuation of immunosuppressive treatments since viral clearing may be hampered in such cases. In contrast, it has also been hypothesized that overactive immune responses may trigger a cytokine storm associated with clinical deterioration, which has generated an interest in certain immunosuppressant drugs as potential treatment for COVID-19. We would like to present the first case report of a patient who was formally diagnosed with COVID-19 while being under disease-modifying treatment with rituximab, an anti-CD20 B cell depleting agent, for multiple sclerosis.

We present the autopsy report of a woman with infantile AxD carrying an R239C mutation in the glial fibrillary acidic protein gene, who survived 39 years. She presented with psychomotor retardation in infancy and regressed after age 5. Brain computed tomography scans showed bilateral low frontal white matter density. She became quadriplegic with bulbar palsy and was intellectually handicapped after a measles infection at age 7. Tube feeding was introduced because of dysphagia at age 15. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation was required due to central hypoventilation in her early thirties. She died of neurogenic respiratory failure at 39 years. Autopsy findings revealed a markedly atrophic brain (709\u2009g, -6.0 standard deviation), especially in the frontal lobe, cerebellum, and brainstem portions. We found demyelination, gliosis, and cystic lesions throughout the brain, and we saw Rosenthal fibers accumulating in the perivascular spaces. We also identified a variety of abnormalities in other organs such as pancreatic necrosis, completely desquamated epithelium in the lower esophagus and stomach, foreign-body giant cells in the colon submucosa, glomerular sclerosis, and multiple bladder stones.

Results: The MS group with cognitive impairments performed worse compared with the MS with no cognitive impairments and HC on both the WCPA and DKEFS. Better scores on the DKEFS were associated with better performance of the WCPA. WCPA was a significant predictor of three of the four AR variables.

Recently, a paradigm shift occurred following the discovery of meningeal lymphatic structures in the human central nervous system (CNS); these structures may be a key drainage route for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the peripheral blood and may also contribute to inflammatory reaction and immune surveillance of the CNS. Lymphatic vessels located along the dural sinuses absorb CSF from the adjacent subarachnoid space and brain interstitial fluid via the glymphatic system, which is composed of aquaporin-4 water channels expressed on perivascular astrocytic end-feet membranes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) clearly visualized these lymphatic vessels in the human dura mater. The conception of some neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, has been changed by this paradigm shift. Meningeal lymphatic vessels could be a promising therapeutic target for the prevention of neurological disorders. However, the involvement of meningeal lymphatic vessels in the pathophysiology has not been fully elucidated and is the subject of future investigations. In this article, to understand the involvement of meningeal lymphatic vessels in neurological disorders, we review the differences between lymphangiogenesis in the CNS and in other tissues during both developmental and adulthood stages, and pathological conditions that may be associated with meningeal lymphatic vessels in the CNS.", "868": "In this review, we summarize the clinical data addressing a potential role for gluten in multiple sclerosis (MS), psoriasis, type 1 diabetes (T1D) and autoimmune thyroid diseases (ATDs). Furthermore, data on the prevalence of celiac disease (CD) and gluten-related antibodies in the above patient groups are presented. Adequately powered and properly controlled intervention trials investigating the effects of a gluten-free diet (GFD) in non-celiac patients with MS, psoriasis, T1D or ATDs are lacking. Only one clinical trial has studied the effects of a GFD among patients with MS. The trial found significant results, but it is subject to major methodological limitations. A few publications have found beneficial effects of a GFD in a subgroup of patients with psoriasis that were seropositive for anti-gliadin or deamidated gliadin antibodies, but no effects were seen among seronegative patients. Studies on the role of gluten in T1D are contradictive, however, it seems likely that a GFD may contribute to normalizing metabolic control without affecting levels of islet autoantibodies. Lastly, the effects of a GFD in non-celiac patients with ATDs have not been studied yet, but some publications report that thyroid-related antibodies respond to a GFD in patients with concomitant CD and ATDs. Overall, there is currently not enough evidence to recommend a GFD to non-celiac patients with MS, psoriasis, ATDs or T1D.", "869": "Optic neuritis (ON) and multiple sclerosis (MS) are complex diseases with multifactorial pathogenesis.

Several studies suggest that curcumin may have a beneficial impact on the brain pathology and aging. These effects are due to curcumin's antioxidant, free-radical scavenging, and anti-inflammatory activity. In light of this, our current review aims to discuss the role of astrocytes as essential players in neurodegenerative diseases and suggest that curcumin is capable of direct inhibition of astrocyte activity with a particular focus on its effects in Alexander disease, Alzheimer's disease, ischemia stroke, spinal cord injury, Multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease.", "874": "Dimethyl fumarate (DMF), a Nrf2 activator approved for multiple sclerosis (MS) in 2013, showed promising antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects against cerebral injury.

Diabetic patients' mortality rates with COVID-19 are higher than those of cardiovascular or cancer patients. Recently, Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine has shown successful results in reversing diabetes in both rats and clinical trials based on different mechanisms from aerobic glycolysis to beta cells regeneration. BCG is a multi-face vaccine that has been used extensively in protection from tuberculosis (TB) and leprosy and has been repositioned for treatment of bladder cancer, diabetes and multiple sclerosis. Recently, COVID-19 epidemiological studies confirmed that universal BCG vaccination reduced morbidity and mortality in certain geographical areas. Countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, Nederland, USA) have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and long-standing BCG policies that have shown low numbers of reported COVID-19 cases. Some countries have started clinical trials that included a single dose BCG vaccine as prophylaxis from COVID-19 or an attempt to minimize its side effects. This proposed research aims to use BCG vaccine as a double-edged weapon countering both COVID-19 and diabetes, not only as protection but also as therapeutic vaccination.

Autoantibodies (autoAbs) are known biomarker candidates although their detection in biological fluids requires a thorough characterization of their associated antigens. Over the past twenty years, a reverse chemical-based approach aiming to screen putative autoantigens has underlined the role of glycans, in particular glucose, in MS. Despite the progress achieved, a lack of consensus regarding the nature of innate antigens as well as difficulties proposing new synthetic glucose-based structures have proved to be obstacles. Here is proposed a strategy to extend the current methodology to the field of natural glycosides, in order to dramatically increase the diversity of glycans that could be tested. Triterpene saponins from the Sapindaceace family represent an optimal starting material as their abundant description in the literature has revealed a prevalence of glucose-based oligosaccharides. Blighia welwitschii (Sapindaceae) was thus selected as a case study and twelve triterpene saponins were isolated and characterized. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR as well as mass spectrometry, revealing seven undescribed compounds. A selection of natural glycosides exhibiting various oligosaccharide moieties were then tested as antigens in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to recognize IgM antibodies (Abs) in MS patients' sera. Immunoassay results indicated a correlation between the glycan structures and their antibody recognition capacity, allowing the determination of structure-activity relationships that were coherent with previous studies.

In particular, changes in gut microbiota can promote enteric and peripheral neurogenic/inflammatory responses, which, in turn, could contribute to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in the central nervous system (CNS). Of note, the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain leucine rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome acts as a key player in both coordinating the host physiology and shaping the peripheral and central immune/inflammatory responses in CNS diseases. In this context, there is pioneering evidence supporting the existence of a microbiota-gut-inflammasome-brain axis, in which enteric bacteria modulate, via NLRP3 signaling, inflammatory pathways that, in turn, contribute to influence brain homeostasis. The present review provides an overview of current knowledge on the role of microbiota-gut-inflammasome-brain axis in the major CNS diseases, including PD, AD, MS, ASD and MDD. In particular, though no direct and causal correlation among altered gut microbiota, NLRP3 activation and brain pathology has been demonstrated and in-depth studies are needed in this setting, our purpose was to pave the way to a novel and pioneering perspective on the pathophysiology of CNS disorders.

The psychometric properties of the AES have been examined in various clinical cohorts, including individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), acquired brain injury, multiple sclerosis, severe mental illness, and cognitively healthy middle-aged cohort who are at risk for AD. The AES is a useful, reliable, and valid instrument to quantify and measure severity of apathy symptoms in adults. It is important to note that the AES-C and AES-S were able to discriminate apathy from depression and anxiety better than the AES-I did. It has been translated into Japanese, Portuguese, German, and Turkish.

Both patients were referred to the infertility clinic because of the concern of exacerbation of multiple sclerosis during or after ovarian stimulation treatment. The patients underwent the in-vitro maturation protocol to avoid ovarian stimulating agents. Both patients gave birth to healthy babies at term. They did not suffer any relapses of multiple sclerosis during their treatment or during pregnancy. Exacerbation of disease related to ovarian stimulation encourages the search for a safer approach to these patients.

Specific pharmacotherapy is an important pillar of a multimodal therapy strategy that should finally follow a biopsychosocial approach. Unfortunately, classic WHO-Step-I analgesics fail to treat NP. According to current evidence, a permanent therapy with opioids (WHO-Step-II and -III) exposes patients to long-term risks that can hardly justify the midterm success of these substances. Therefore, knowledge of the dosage, use and side effects of the first-line drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) and gabapentinoids is essential. Treatment should follow the \"start low, go slow\" concept, while a good patient education is crucial. Topical therapy with Lidocaine and Ambroxol actively includes the patient in the therapy regimen. High-dose therapy with capsaicin patches (8 %) remains in the hands of pain specialists. Perioperative prevention of neuropathic pain with systemic medication failed to prove efficacy by now. However, the perineural application of local anaesthetics using nerve blocks in thoracic and breast surgery as well as in caesarean section showed potential to prevent chronic, postoperative pain (CPOP).

Objective To explore payments from the industry to\u00a0physicians in various neurology subspecialties. Methods Open Payments Program (OPP) data (https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov) on industry-to-physician payments for the years 2014-2018 were extracted for general neurology, neuromuscular, neurophysiology, and vascular neurology. The data were then analyzed to explore trends in payments for various subspecialties and to identify the possible factors underlying these trends. Results Overall, industry-to-physician payments for neurology subspecialties increased by 16% from 2014 to 2018. The introduction of newer drugs in a subspecialty was likely the driving factor for higher industry payments. Nearly half of the total industry-to-physician payments were for the subspecialty of multiple sclerosis (MS)/Neuroimmunology; this coincided with Aubagio and Copaxone being the top two medications associated with the highest industry payments in 2014, Aubagio, and Lemtrada in 2018. A significant increase in spending percentages for headache, neuromuscular disorders, and movement disorders was observed while a relative decrease in the payments for MS/neuroimmunology and epilepsy was identified; these trends coincide with the introduction of new drugs such as Aimovig, Neuplazid, Nusinersen, and Austedo for headache, neuromuscular and movement disorders. Conclusions From 2014 to 2018, the total industry-to-physician payments for neurology subspecialties\u00a0increased while the distribution of industry-to-physician payments for various neurology subspecialties showed notable changes.\u00a0The introduction of newer medications in a subspecialty coincided with higher industry payments.

An excessive IIR is the pathological basis for the generation and development of neurological diseases. Ginkgolides are one of the important medicinal ingredients in <i>Ginkgo biloba</i>. Many studies have verified that ginkgolides have anti-platelet-activating, anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidative, neurotrophic, and neuroimmunomodulatory effects. Inflammatory immunomodulation is mediated by inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathways.

Although EAE is predominantly considered a T helper 1-driven autoimmune disease, mounting evidence suggests that activated dendritic cells (DC), which are the bridge between innate and adaptive immunity, also contribute to its pathogenesis. Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), a NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylase involved in genome maintenance and in metabolic homeostasis, regulates DC activation, and its pharmacological inhibition could, therefore, play a role in EAE development.", "901": "In this paper, a model is proposed of the pathophysiological processes of COVID-19 starting from the infection of human type II alveolar epithelial cells (pneumocytes) by SARS-CoV-2 and culminating in the development of ARDS. The innate immune response to infection of type II alveolar epithelial cells leads both to their death by apoptosis and pyroptosis and to alveolar macrophage activation. Activated macrophages secrete proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and tend to polarise into the inflammatory M1 phenotype. These changes are associated with activation of vascular endothelial cells and thence the recruitment of highly toxic neutrophils and inflammatory activated platelets into the alveolar space. Activated vascular endothelial cells become a source of proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and contribute to the development of coagulopathy, systemic sepsis, a cytokine storm and ARDS. Pulmonary activated platelets are also an important source of proinflammatory cytokines and ROS, as well as exacerbating pulmonary neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses and contributing to systemic sepsis by binding to neutrophils to form platelet-neutrophil complexes (PNCs). PNC formation increases neutrophil recruitment, activation priming and extraversion of these immune cells into inflamed pulmonary tissue, thereby contributing to ARDS. Sequestered PNCs cause the development of a procoagulant and proinflammatory environment. The contribution to ARDS of increased extracellular histone levels, circulating mitochondrial DNA, the chromatin protein HMGB1, decreased neutrophil apoptosis, impaired macrophage efferocytosis, the cytokine storm, the toll-like receptor radical cycle, pyroptosis, necroinflammation, lymphopenia and a high Th17 to regulatory T lymphocyte ratio are detailed.", "902": "Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis (NMDARe) can coexist with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody (MOG-ab) disease.To characterize MOG-ab disease during NMDARe, we analyzed all the patients with MOG-ab disease and NMDARe from our hospital from December 2018 to December 2019 and data from a systematical review of previously published reports.

In this study, we applied the T1w/T2w method to detect changes in tissue microstructure in ME/CFS patients relative to healthy controls. We mapped the T1w/T2w signal intensity values in the whole brain for forty-five ME/CFS patients who met Fukuda criteria and twenty-seven healthy controls and applied both region- and voxel-based quantification. We also performed interaction-with-group regressions with clinical measures to test for T1w/T2w relationships that are abnormal in ME/CFS at the population level. Region-based analysis showed significantly elevated T1w/T2w values (increased myelin and/or iron) in ME/CFS in both white matter (WM) and subcortical grey matter. The voxel-based group comparison with sub-millimetre resolution voxels detected very significant clusters with increased T1w/T2w in ME/CFS, mostly in subcortical grey matter, but also in brainstem and projection WM tracts. No areas with decreased T1w/T2w were found in either analysis. ME/CFS T1w/T2w regressions with heart-rate variability, cognitive performance, respiration rate and physical well-being were abnormal in both gray and white matter foci.

If this remains untreated, traumatic CNS injuries may lead to early development of several neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson, multiple sclerosis, and other mental illnesses. The initial physical reaction, which is also termed as the primary phase, includes swelling, followed by inflammation as a result of internal haemorrhage causing damage to indigenous tissue, i.e., axonal shear injury, rupture of blood vessels, and partial impaired supply of oxygen and essential nutrients in the neurons, thereby initiating a cascade of events causing secondary injuries such as hypoxia, hypotension, cognitive impairment, seizures, imbalanced calcium homeostasis and glutamate-induced excitotoxicity resulting in concomitant neuronal cell death and cumulative permanent tissue damage. In the modern era of advanced biomedical technology, we are still living with scarcity of the clinically applicable comparative non-invasive therapeutic strategies for regeneration or functional recovery of neurons or neural networks after a massive CNS injury. One of the key reasons for this scarcity is the limited regenerative ability of neurons in CNS.

Thirty participants with TSC (11-21 years, 20 females, IQ = 35-108) underwent brief (approximately 1 h) daytime actigraph assessment during two settings: movie viewing and cognitive testing. Multiple linear regressions were used to test associations between movement measurements and parent-rated ADHD symptoms. Correlations were used to examine associations between actigraph measures and parent-rated ADHD symptoms and other characteristics of TSC (symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual ability (IQ), epilepsy severity, cortical tuber count). Higher movement levels during movies were associated with higher parent-rated ADHD symptoms. Higher ADHD symptoms and actigraph-measured movement levels during movies were positively associated with ASD symptoms and negatively associated with IQ. Inter-individual variability of movement during movies was not associated with parent-rated hyperactivity or IQ but was negatively associated with ASD symptoms. There were no associations with tuber count or epilepsy. Our findings suggest that actigraph-measured movement provides a useful correlate of ADHD in TSC.", "942": "Neurological disorders (ND) are the central nervous system (CNS) related complications originated by enhanced oxidative stress, mitochondrial failure and overexpression of proteins like S100B. S100B is a helix-loop-helix protein with calcium-binding domain associated to various neurological disorders through activation of MAPK pathway, increased NFkB expression results in cell survival, proliferation and gene up-regulation. S100B protein plays a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, Schizophrenia and epilepsy because high expression of this protein directly targets astrocytes and promote neuroinflammation. Under stressful conditions, S100B produces toxic effect mediated through receptor for advanced glycation end products (AGE) binding. S100B also mediate neuroprotection, minimize microgliosis and reduce the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) but that are concentration-dependent mechanisms. Increased level of S100B useful for assessing release of inflammatory markers, nitric oxide and excitotoxicity dependent neuronal loss. The present review summarizes the role of S100B in various neurological disorders and potential therapeutic measure to reduce the prevalence of neurological disorders.", "943": "Only a few studies have been done focusing on the quality of life (QoL) of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) as well as their family members.

The current ALS-approved drugs modestly change the clinical course of the disease. The mechanism by which motor neurons progressively degenerate remains unclear but entails a non-cell autonomous process. Astrocytes impaired biological functionality were implicated in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Alzheimer disease (AD). In ALS disease patients, A1 reactive astrocytes were found to play a key role in the pathology of ALS disease and death of motor neurons, via loss or gain of function or acquired toxicity. The contribution of astrocytes to the maintenance of motor neurons by diverse mechanisms makes them a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of ALS. Therapeutic approaches targeting at modulating the function of endogenous astrocytes or replacing lost functionality by transplantation of healthy astrocytes, may contribute to the development of therapies which might slow down or even halt the progression ALS diseases. The proposed mechanisms by which astrocytes can potentially ameliorate ALS progression and the status of ALS clinical studies involving astrocytes are discussed.", "945": "Proteoglycans (PGs) are one of the main components in the extracellular matrix of the central nervous system. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is a glycosaminoglycan (GAG), which is composed of major PGs. Similar to keratin sulfate (KS), another GAG, CS inhibits axon regeneration. However, the influence of these GAGs on the pathogenicity of neuroimmunological diseases is unclear. Here, we induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice lacking CS N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-1 (CSGalNAcT1-KO), an important enzyme for CS synthesis. In our study, CSGalNAcT1-KO mice showed milder EAE symptoms than those in wild-type (WT) mice. The recall response of antigen-specific lymphocytes showed that CSGalNAcT1-KO-derived lymphocytes had a milder cell proliferation response than that in WT-derived lymphocytes. These results suggest that CS contributes toward the induction phase of EAE. We previously performed EAE experiments in GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase KO (GlcNAc6ST-KO) and C6ST1-KO mice, which had reduced KS and reduced CS-C, respectively. EAE in CSGalNAcT1-KO mice was more similar to that in GlcNAc6ST-KO mice than in C6ST1-KO mice. In conclusion, the distinct GAG sugar chains are associated with severe or mild phenotypes of EAE and are therefore potential new therapeutic targets for neuroimmunological diseases, including multiple sclerosis.", "946": "Disability accumulation in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) results from inflammatory and neurodegenerative mechanisms.

In total the opinions of 124 MS patients were explored with a questionnaire, which was developed to investigate the consumption behavior and associated beneficial and harmful effects of coffee and caffeine concerning symptoms of fatigue. <i>Results</i>: Our study showed that 37.1% of the included patients experience severe symptoms of fatigue. In our cohort, fatigue was not related to age, type of diagnosis or duration of the disease. The effects of coffee did not differ between MS patients with and without fatigue. Very few side effects linked to coffee consumption were reported, and we could demonstrate that coffee consumption had no negative impact on quality of sleep. A positive effect on everyday life was observed particularly among patients with a mid-level expanded disability status scale (EDSS). The strongest effects of coffee consumption were observed regarding a better ability to concentrate while fulfilling tasks, an expanded attention span and a better structured daily routine. <i>Conclusions</i>: Since coffee showed no severe side effects and in the absence of an effective fatigue therapy, coffee consumption might be a therapeutic approach for selected patients with MS-related fatigue.", "954": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is usually diagnosed between twenty and forty years of age, when people often plan to have children. A lot has been said about the effect of pregnancy on the course of MS. The individual factors responsible for the disease modifying effect of pregnancy are not well determined. Having MS neither affects the fertility or the course of pregnancy itself. During pregnancy, many women find that their symptoms stay the same or even improve. Epidural and spinal analgesia appear to be safe and in general are not contraindicated for patients with MS. The management of disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) in pregnancy is a new issue for consideration in the clinical practice. There is limited information available into the safety of DMT use during pregnancy, especially for the most recent ones. In general, discontinuation of DMTs is recommended before conception to minimize risk of fetal harm. Women with very active MS before pregnancy who stop second-line treatments may show an increase in disease activity during pregnancy. Therefore, it might be discussed to maintain patients on DMTs until pregnancy is confirmed, and sometimes throughout pregnancy, to avoid a rebound of disease activity and severe relapses during pregnancy in very active patients.", "955": "Neurodegenerative diseases comprise a large number of disorders with high impact on human health. Neurodegenerative processes are caused by various etiological factors and differ in their clinical presentation. Neuroinflammation is widely discussed as both a cause and a consequence in the manifestation of these disorders. The interplay between the two entities is considered as a major contributor to the ongoing disease progression. An attentive search and implementation of new and reliable markers specific for the processes of inflammation and degeneration is still needed. YKL-40 is a secreted glycoprotein produced by activated glial cells during neuroinflammation. Neuron-specific enolase (NSE), expressed mainly by neuronal cells, is a long-standing marker for neuronal damage. The aim of this review is to summarize, clarify, and evaluate the potential significance and relationship between YKL-40 and NSE as biomarkers in the monitoring and prognosis of a set of neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis. YKL-40 appears to be a more reliable biomarker in neurological diseases than NSE. The more prominent expression pattern of YKL-40 could be explained with the more obvious involvement of glial cells in pathological processes accompanying each neurodegenerative disease, whereas reduced NSE levels are likely related to low metabolic activity and increased death of neurons.", "956": "<i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (<i>H. pylori</i>) is a bacterium that infects more than a half of world's population.

According to the current evidence, whereas this bacterium is a risk factor for some of these manifestations, it might play a protective role in other pathological conditions. In that context, when considered the gastrointestinal tract, <i>H. pylori</i> positivity have been related to Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease, Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, Hepatic Carcinoma, Cholelithiasis, and Cholecystitis. Moreover, lower serum levels of iron and vitamin B12 have been found in patients with <i>H. pylori</i> infection, leading to the emergence of anemias in a portion of them. With regards to neurological manifestations, a growing number of studies have associated that bacterium with multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Interestingly, the risk of developing cardiovascular disorders, such as atherosclerosis, is also influenced by the infection. Besides that, the <i>H. pylori</i>-associated inflammation may also lead to increased insulin resistance, leading to a higher risk of diabetes mellitus among infected individuals.

In light of anti-CD20 therapies for MS, the susceptibility of B cells to TMEV infection is particularly important. In our study, direct viral exposure to macrophages and lymphocytes resulted in viral replication and cellular stimulation in the order of DCs, macrophages, B cells, and T cells. Notably, B cells produced viral proteins and expressed elevated levels of CD69, an activation marker. Similarly, the expression of major histocompatibility complex class II and costimulatory molecules in B cells was upregulated. Moreover, TMEV-infected B cells showed elevated levels of antigen-presenting function and antibody production. TMEV infection appeared to polyclonally activate B cells to produce autoantibodies and further T cell stimulation.

TLR4 signaling initiates transcription factor NF-\u03baB and production of proinflammatory cytokines. TLR4 contributes to the development or progression of various diseases including stroke, neuropathic pain, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer, and better therapeutics are currently sought for these conditions. In this study, a library of 140\u00a0000 compounds was virtually screened and a resulting hit-list of 1000 compounds was tested using a cellular reporter system. The topoisomerase II inhibitor mitoxantrone and its analogues pixantrone and mitoxantrone (2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine were identified as inhibitors of TLR4 and NF-\u03baB activation. Mitoxantrone was shown to bind directly to the TLR4, and pixantrone and mitoxantrone (2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine were shown to inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) in primary microglia. The inhibitory effect on NF-\u03baB activation or on TNF\u03b1 production was not mediated through cytotoxity at \u2264 1\u00a0\u00b5M concentration for pixantrone and mitoxantrone (2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine treated cells, as assessed by ATP counts.

This chronic disease has a high prevalence in the world and also in Iran. Fatigue is a common symptom of the disease, which causes serious mental and psychological discomfort. Simple saffron syrup, contains some compounds that can be effective in relieving the symptom. The object of this study is to investigate the effect of simple saffron syrup on fatigue in patients with MS. Methods This study is a pre-post study which evaluates the fatigue rate of MS patients (30 participants) according to the FSS scale. The participants were given a saffron simple syrup to consume a tablespoon (7.5 cc) every 8\u00a0h for two months. After 60\u00a0days of prescribing, patients are assessed for fatigue based on fatigue severity scale (FSS) criteria. Results One-way ANOVA showed that there was a notable difference between the mean score of fatigue in MS patients before and after the intervention (p<0.001). So, the fatigue severity of the subjects after saffron syrup consumption dropped dramatically for two months. (p<00.01).

Although different therapeutic strategies have been developed and tried until now to decrease the neurological decline, no treatment has been found to cure these pathologies. In the last decades, the implication of the endocannabinoid system in the neurological function has been extensively studied, and the cannabinoids have been tried as a new promising potential treatment. In this study, we aimed to overview the recent available literature regarding in vivo potential of natural and synthetic cannabinoids with underlying mechanisms of action for protecting against cognitive decline and motor impairments. The results of studies on animal models showed that cannabinoids in traumatic brain injury increase neurobehavioral function, working memory performance, and decrease the neurological deficit and ameliorate motor deficit through down-regulation of pro-inflammatory markers, oedema formation and blood-brain barrier permeability, preventing neuronal cell loss and up-regulating the levels of adherence junction proteins. In neurodegenerative diseases, the cannabinoids showed beneficial effects in decreasing the motor disability and disease progression by a complex mechanism targeting more signalling pathways further than classical receptors of the endocannabinoid system. In light of these results, the use of cannabinoids could be beneficial in traumatic brain injuries and multiple sclerosis treatment, especially in those patients who display resistance to conventional treatment.", "962": "The presence of foamy macrophages and microglia containing intracellular myelin remnants is a pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS).

These include cardiovascular disease, psychiatric and neurologic disturbances, restless leg syndrome, migraine, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and metabolic disorders. Comorbid disease is an important consideration for clinicians treating patients with MS; early presentation of comorbidities can obscure or delay MS diagnosis, as well as significantly impacting the disease course. Improved understanding of comorbidities and their emergence in MS populations is important for improving the quality of life and optimizing treatment for patients. Therefore, we evaluated published studies reporting epidemiologic data on comorbidities and their associated impact on disease progression in patients with MS (PwMS). The prevalence of neurologic, cardiovascular, metabolic, and autoimmune comorbidities was elevated in PwMS in general, and furthermore, this adversely affected a broad range of outcomes. Compared with PwMS, cancer rates in people without MS or the general population were lower, which should prompt further studies into the mechanisms of both diseases.

Beneficial effects of the combination of both strategies on cognitive function have been described in both ageing adults and patients with neurodegenerative diseases, such as MS. The analysis of combining both physical and cognitive stimulation can be summarized by the environmental enrichment (EE) experiments, which are more suitable for animal models. EE refers to housing conditions consisting of exercise and cognitive and social stimulation.

An additional important function of Gas6-TAM signalling appears to be the regulation of immunity and inflammation, which remains to be fully elucidated in the CNS. Here, we characterised the expression of TAM receptors and ligands in individual CNS glial cell types, observing high expression of Gas6 and the TAM receptors, Mer and Axl, in microglia, and high expression of Tyro3 in astrocytes. We also investigated the effect of Gas6 on the inflammatory cytokine response in the optic nerve and in mixed glial cell cultures from wildtype and single TAM receptor knockout mice. In wildtype and Mer-deficient cultures, Gas6 significantly stimulated the expression of the anti-inflammatory/pro-repair cytokines interleukin 10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), whereas this effect was absent in either Tyro3 or Axl knockout cultures. Furthermore, Gas6 caused upregulation of myelin basic protein (MBP) expression in optic nerves, which was blocked by a neutralising antibody against IL-10. In conclusion, our data show that microglia are both a major source of Gas6 as well as an effector of Gas6 action in the CNS through the upregulation of anti-inflammatory and pro-repair mediators. Furthermore, the presence of both Axl and Tyro3 receptors appears to be necessary for these effects of Gas6. In addition, IL-10, alongside suppressing inflammation and immunity, mediates the pro-myelinating mechanism of Gas6 action in the optic nerve. Therefore, Gas6 may present an attractive target for novel therapeutic interventions for demyelinating as well as neuroinflammatory disorders of the CNS.", "970": "Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) are a group of autoimmune inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system (CNS).

For this reason here, we have not only analyzed the impact on increased risk of MS of the best known factors (<i>HLA-DRB1*15:01</i> allele, sun exposure, vitamin D levels, smoking habit), but we have included another factor (skin phototype) that has not been analyzed in depth until now. This study included 149 MS patients and 147 controls. A multivariate logistic regression (LR) model was carried out to determine the impact of each of the factors on the increased risk of MS. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate predictive value of the models. Our multifactorial LR model of susceptibility showed that females with light brown skin (LBS), smokers and who had <i>HLA-DRB1*15:01</i> allele had a higher MS risk (LBS: OR = 5.90, IC95% = 2.39-15.45; smoker: OR = 4.52, IC95% = 2.69-7.72; presence of <i>HLA-DRB1*15:01</i>: OR = 2.39, IC95% = 1.30-4.50; female: OR = 1.88, IC95% = 1.08-3.30). This model had an acceptable discriminant value with an Area Under a Curve AUC of 0.76 (0.69-0.82).

We herein hypothesize that humoral and cellular immune responses induced by active Hp-I, beyond damaging locally the gastric mucosa, they may shape the character of systemic autoimmune responses, contributing to MS pathogenesis. To investigate our hypothesis, active Hp-I has been diagnosed in two small MS Greek cohorts by using primarily gastric mucosa histology. A higher prevalence of active Hp-I was documented in MS patients vs. controls (86.4 vs. 50%, P\u202f=\u202f0.002)accompanied by exclusive existence of duodenal ulcer and autoimmune diseases with endoscopic and histological findings of chronic active gastritis for the MS group.

Using the homogenates, we identified proteins that interacted with SOD1\u2009seeds in vitro. We assessed differences in SOD1-interacting proteins in cell cultures treated with proteasome or autophagy inhibitor. In the first experiment, intermediate filamentous and small heat shock proteins were upregulated in glial cells. We identified 26 protein types that interacted with aggregation cores in ALS model homogenates, and unexpectedly, 40 proteins in were detected in NTG mice. In cell cultures treated with proteasome and autophagy inhibitors, we identified 16 and 11 SOD1-interacting proteins, respectively, and seven proteins in untreated cells. These SOD1-interacting proteins were involved in multiple cellular functions such as protein quality control, cytoskeletal organization, and pathways involved in growth factor signaling and their downstream cascades.

The loss of TDP-43 function that is associated with these inclusions affects post-transcriptional processing of RNAs in multiple ways including pre-mRNA splicing, nucleocytoplasmic transport, modulation of mRNA stability and translation. In contrast, less is known about the role of TDP-43 in axonal RNA metabolism in motoneurons. Here we show that depletion of Tdp-43 in primary motoneurons affects axon growth. This defect is accompanied by subcellular transcriptome alterations in the axonal and somatodendritic compartment. The axonal localization of transcripts encoding components of the cytoskeleton, the translational machinery and transcripts involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism were particularly affected by loss of Tdp-43. Accordingly, we observed reduced protein synthesis and disturbed mitochondrial functions in axons of Tdp-43-depleted motoneurons. Treatment with nicotinamide rescued the axon growth defect associated with loss of Tdp-43. These results show that Tdp-43 depletion in motoneurons affects several pathways integral to axon health indicating that loss of TDP-43 function could thus make a major contribution to axonal pathomechanisms in ALS.", "980": "Obesity is linked to greater physical disability and increased comorbidities among patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).

The natural history of multiple sclerosis appears milder from the first sign of demyelinating disease to the progressive course, probably as a result of an interplay between several factors including changes in the diagnostic criteria, changes in the epidemiology of multiple sclerosis, impact of early and appropriate disease-modifying treatment and improvement of the general state of health in the population. It has been suggested to regard incidental findings of demyelinating lesions in MRI in individuals without any history of clinical symptoms consistent with neurological dysfunction, so-called radiological isolated syndrome, as the initial course of multiple sclerosis. New diagnostic criteria have enabled the multiple sclerosis diagnosis in many patients at the first clinical demyelinating event, clinically isolated syndrome. The remaining patients with clinically isolated syndrome have a more benign prognosis, and for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, the prognosis has become more favourable. Reduced disease activity in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis can partly be ascribed to more efficacious new disease-modifying therapies but decrease in disease activity has also be seen in placebo-treated patients in clinical trials. This may be explained by several factors: change in the diagnostic criteria, more explicit inclusion criteria, exclusion of high-risk patients e.g. patients with co-morbidities, and more rigorous definitions of relapses and disease worsening. However, these factors also make the disease course in patients treated with disease-modifying therapies seem more favourable. In addition, change in the therapeutic target to stable disease (no evidence of disease activity = no relapses, no disease worsening and no MRI activity) could by itself change the course in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The effectiveness of disease-modifying drugs has reduced the transition from relapsing-remitting to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. The concept of progressive multiple sclerosis has also evolved from two very distinct categories (primary progressive and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis) to a unified category of progressive multiple sclerosis, which can then be split into the categories of active or inactive. Also, an increasing tendency to treat progressive multiple sclerosis with disease-modifying therapies may have contributed to change the course in progressive multiple sclerosis. In conclusion, during the past decade the entire course of multiple sclerosis from the first sign of a demyelinating disorder through the progressive course appears to be milder due to a complex interplay of several factors.", "983": "The modulation of the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor is an approved treatment for relapsing multiple sclerosis because of its anti-inflammatory effect of retaining lymphocytes in lymph nodes. Different sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor subtypes are expressed in the brain and spinal cord, and their pharmacological effects may improve disease development and neuropathology. Siponimod (BAF312) is a novel sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator that has recently been approved for the treatment of active secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). In this review article, we summarize recent evidence suggesting that the active role of siponimod in patients with progressive MS may be due to direct interaction with central nervous system cells. Additionally, we tried to summarize our current understanding of the function of siponimod and discuss the effects observed in the case of MS.", "984": "To explore Dawson's fingers in cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) and factors related to the development of Dawson's finger, we collected and analyzed clinical data of 65 patients with CSVD. We found a venous abnormality feature called Dawson's fingers around the ventricles in magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of 20 out of 65 patients with CSVD (30. 8%). A significant association between Dawson's fingers and diabetes mellitus (DM) was also detected (30 vs. 8.9%, <i>P</i> < 0.05). CSVD patients with Dawson's fingers had significantly increased cerebral microbleeds (CMB) (44.2 vs. 75.0%, <i>p</i> < 0.05), lacunae (66.7 vs. 95.0%, <i>p</i> < 0.05), and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) (<i>p</i> < 0.05) damage, and these patients exhibited significant cognitive domain impairment as assessed via Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (18.9 \u00b1 1.8 vs. 24.0 \u00b1 0.8, <i>p</i> < 0.05) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (24.5 \u00b1 1.1 vs. 26.6 \u00b1 0.6, <i>p</i> < 0.05). Our results show a distinctly high incidence of Dawson's fingers in CSVD patients and identify a significant association with DM, thus yielding insights about the appropriate use of Dawson's fingers, a venous imaging marker, to explore the basic pathophysiology of CSVD.", "985": "<b>Objective:</b> To evaluate the sensitivity to change of differently calculated quantitative scores from motor evoked potentials (MEP) in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). <b>Methods:</b> Twenty patients with PPMS had MEP to upper and lower limbs at baseline, years 1 and 2 measured in addition to clinical assessment [Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), ambulation score]; a subsample (<i>n</i> = 9) had a nine-hole peg test (NHPT) and a timed 25-foot walk (T25FW). Quantitative MEP scores for upper limbs (qMEP-UL), lower limbs (qMEP-LL), and all limbs (qMEP) were calculated in three different ways, based on <i>z</i>-transformed central motor conduction time (CMCT), shortest corticomuscular latency (CxM-sh), and mean CxM (CxM-mn). Changes in clinical measures and qMEP metrics were analyzed by repeated-measures analysis of variance (rANOVA), and a factor analysis was performed on change in qMEP metrics. <b>Results:</b> Expanded Disability Status Scale and ambulation score progressed in the rANOVA model (<i>p</i> < 0.05; <i>post-hoc</i> comparison baseline-year 2, <i>p</i> < 0.1). Lower limb and combined qMEP scores showed significant deterioration of latency (<i>p</i> < 0.01, MEP-LL_CxM-sh: <i>p</i> < 0.05) and in <i>post-hoc</i> comparisons (baseline-year 2, <i>p</i> < 0.05), qMEP_CxM-mn even over 1 year (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Effect sizes were higher for qMEP scores than for clinical measures, and slightly but consistently higher when based on CxM-mn compared to CxM-sh or CMCT. Subgroup analysis yielded no indication of higher sensitivity of timed clinical measures over qMEP scores. Two independent factors were detected, the first mainly associated with qMEP-LL, the second with qMEP-UL, explaining 65 and 29% of total variability, respectively. <b>Conclusions:</b> Deterioration in qMEP scores occurs earlier than EDSS progression in patients with PPMS. Upper and lower limb qMEP scores contribute independently to measuring change, and qMEP scores based on mean CxM are advantageous. The capability to detect subclinical changes longitudinally is a unique property of EP and complementary to clinical assessment. These features underline the role of EP as candidate biomarkers to measure effects of therapeutic interventions in PPMS.", "986": "<b>Introduction:</b> Persons with MS (PwMS) have markedly reduced push-off and toe-clearance during gait compared to healthy subjects (HS). These deficits may result from alterations in neuromotor control at the ankle. To optimize rehabilitation interventions for PwMS, a crucial step is to evaluate if and how altered neuromotor control, as represented by muscle synergies, improves with rehabilitation. In this study we investigated changes in ankle motor control and associated biomechanical parameters during gait in PwMS, occurring with increase in speed after gait rehabilitation. <b>Methods:</b> 3D motion and EMG data were collected while 11 PwMS (age 50.3 + 11.1; EDSS 5.2 + 1.2) walked overground at self-selected speed before (T0) and after 20 sessions (T1) of intensive treadmill training. Muscle synergies were extracted using non-negative matrix factorization. Gait parameters were computed according to the LAMB protocol. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the similarity of motor modules between PwMS and HS. To assess differences in distal module activations representing neuromotor control at the ankle [Forward Propulsion (FPM) and Ground Clearance modules (GCM)], each module's activation timing was integrated over 100% of the gait cycle and the activation percentage index (API) was computed in six phases. Ten age matched HS provided two separate speed-matched normative datasets for T0 and T1. For speed independent comparison for the PwMs <i>Z</i> scores were calculated for all their gait variables. <b>Results:</b> In PwMS velocity increased significantly from T0 to T1 (0.74-0.90 m/s, <i>p</i> < 0.05). The activation profiles (API) of FPM and GCM of PwMS improved in pre-swing (<i>p</i> < 0.05): FPM (Mean [95% CI] [%]: T0: 12.5 [5.7-19.3] vs. T1: 9.0 [2.7-15.3]); GCM (T0: 26.7 [18.2-35.3] vs. T1: 24.5 [18.2-30.7]). This was associated with an increase in toe clearance (80.3 to 103.6 mm, <i>p</i> < 0.05) and a higher ankle power peak in pre-swing (1.53-1.93 W/kg, <i>p</i> < 0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> Increased gait speed of PwMS after intensive gait training was consistent with improvements in spatio-temporal gait parameters. The most important finding of this study was the re-organization of distal leg modules related to neurophysiological changes induced by rehabilitation. This was associated with an improved ankle performance.", "987": "Remote measurement technologies (RMT) can be used to collect data on a variety of bio-behavioral variables, which may improve the care of patients with central nervous system disorders. Although various studies have explored their potential, prior work has highlighted a knowledge gap in health care professionals' (HCPs) perceptions of the value of RMT in clinical practice."}}
